    [["I was given 2 snuggies as gifts and they are very warm and comfortable however after just 2 washes the fleece started pilling. For those out there that are unschooled in the differences in fleece, pretty much every fleece in the world is soft and warm to begin with. One of the biggest differences between high quality and low quality fleece lies in the \"pilling effect\". Pilling occurs when the garment's fibers roll up, often after being washed, and lie on the surface like tiny round pills. This pilling seriously effects almost every aspect of the fleece including how it feels and its ability to keep heat in. All fleece pills eventually. You can tell how old a Patagonia synchilla jacket is based off of how much pilling has taken place. High quality fleece doesn't pill for quite some time and cheap fleece starts to pill almost immediately. I had serious pilling after only 2 washes with the Snuggies and I am over 20 washes with my Slankets and they still havent shown any sign of pilling yet.The bottom line - Snuggies are cheaper but you get what you pay for. A Slanket costs more but its going to last you a considerably longer amount of time than the snuggie and it will keep its softness and its ability to keep in warmth much longer than the Snuggie. I gave my Snuggies to the Salvation army and purchased 4 Slankets. My advice is to stay as far away from the Snuggie as possible. Spend a little more and get something that is actually much higher in quality. If however you care more about saving money than actually buying something of quality then maybe the Snuggie is for you after all.", "I purchased the Snuggie as a gift for my mother, who was tickled to receive it. The material is soft yet durable, and the design is just like on the box. It is a one-size fits all, but there is so much material that it will fit anyone except for extremely tall people. There's a pocket included, for remote storage or etc. The box was packaged securely inside another box, so there was no risk of damage. It's a whimsical, fun product. All in all, a good buy and I'd definitely purchase from the seller again, because they shipped quickly and packaged it well.", "Allstar snuggie is just what it advertises.  It is a piece of snuggly fabric that allows you to move and use your hands while you are resting on the couch or bed.  My daughter wanted it for college.", "I bought this for a 21 year old boy because he spends a lot of time at his computer in the basement where it's cold.  I wasn't sure what he'd think of a snuggie, but it turns out he loves it and uses it all the time! The camouflauge made it seem more \"manly\" for him.  Personally, I love my blue snuggie and wear it all the time when I watch TV.", "First off, if you're wondering whether or not you really need a blanket with sleeves, the answer is yes you do indeed. But you may want to look around.The Snuggies I bought a few years ago were made of thick, soft fleece and they're still that way even after a lot of use and many washes. However, I recently bought this one for a friend and although it's cute I'm pretty disappointed by the quality. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the fabric is very, very thin. I'll still give it to her since it looks okay and is soft enough (it's just much closer to \"fuzzy\" than \"plush\").So anyway, it's good enough for a sleeved blanket but just don't expect the quality to match the Snuggies you may have bought in the past.", "Item was wonderful.  My nieceloved it and wears it all the time.  The material is so soft and snuggie. Had looked everywhere for this snuggie, and the only place I could find it was on Amazon.", "This thing is super thin and it gets holes very easily.  I wouldn't buy another snuggie again.  A nice blanket would of been better then this.  We also bought another Snuggie for younger kids and it did the same thing.  If they were thicker or better quality fabric they would of been nice.", "This product is great. Regardless of what people say Snuggies are awesome. unless you like being cold. the only 1 complaint with this Snuggie is.....it's really quite difficult to find the arm holes and know which part is the neck. just wish maybe there was some stitching that's a different color around arms & neck area. wouldnt stop me from buying it though.", "I like my snuggie a lot, and it's the first design that I actually like.  Seems like most of the patterns are pretty ugly.  It's definitely not as warm or fuzzy as my husband's U of M snuggie, but that's ok because I am not really a cold person.  When I am cold, it does the job.  But for really cold people, you might want to look for a little snugglier one.I do wish it were a bit longer (and I am short, 5'2) because I like to flip my feet up and tuck the blanket underneath, and I could do that better if it were a little longer.  But all in all, I am very satisfied with it.", "I got this for a friend for her birthday and she has really enjoyed it. It arrived at her home on time and the price was not bad at all.", "Bought this for my wife and her first response to my question on how to review it was \"give it 4 stars, I like it\" but she couldn't come up with any problems with it so then she decided she \"loves\" it and it's worth the full 5 stars.", "Very soft and comfortable, and I like the color.  Staticky, but it is fleece so what I expected.  Warm!  Could use a little velcro sticky on the back of it; maybe the neck or at a lower point, to keep the Snuggie wrapped around the body.All in all, I am satisfied.", "If you freeze at night, I would recommend a \"Snuggie\" I honestly thought they were ridiculous when I first saw the commercials and laughed about it. My daughter wanted a Snuggie for her birthday & I really didn't think too highly of it but I bought one for her anyway. WELL! I have to say that I had to ask for one for myself for Christmas. Some people call it a backward robe but I don't care. It keeps your front side warm on cold nights. I wear it under my covers and can even bring my arms out to pet the cat w/o losing the warmth of being under the covers.  Is very soft (even after washing) I am even buying 1 for a friend of mine to give as a gift because I guess because I'm just a convert about the \"SNUGGIE\":)", "When I first received my snuggie,it was in perfect condition. I tried it on and it was so warm and comfy. The material used for the snuggie which I'm guessing is fleece is still intacted to this day and does not come off after washing it. Earlier someone sa", "Bought this for my husband as a gift and he loves it.  I just wish it had a couple of velcro strips so it could stay shut by itself when walking around with it on.  The pattern is great for men and an added bonus is the pockets.  I recently received one too and the one I have does not have any pockets.", "The fabric does not feel good at all. My daughter tried to use it a couple of times and it is too polyestery. She had not mentioned anything before because it was given as a gift to her and she felt bad about complaining.", "The snuggie is comfortable and warm although the fleece is fairly thin. I am not too happy that it only comes in one size and since I am short the snuggie is too long on the sleeves and the bottom drags around. Otherwise the fabric is soft and I like the zebra print.", "This is one of the worst products I have ever seen. It boasts about being \"hands free\" and having \"oversized sleeves\" and most laughably of being \"super large.\" It is, in reality, something akin to a quirky fleecy hospital gown that will not enclose the area approximately between your shoulder blades unless you are Bilbo Baggins. It is very cheaply made. The manufacturer also boasts \"now with pockets\" without mentioning that putting anything of any weight into them will make the Snuggie fall off if you stand up in it, not that it's engineered for a strenuous aerobic activity like standing. Of course they also claim it's \"perfect for outdoor events\" which is entirely true if your definition of \"perfect for outdoor events\" involves letting your unclothed posterior poke out of a nightmare garment in public.This is an entirely impractical garment for anyone who ever gets off their couch.For an impossibly practical idea, I offer this alternative: buy a robe.How I came to own a Snuggie with monkeys on it is an entirely more interesting subject, but is one that is, sadly, beyond the scope of the review. Let's just say it involved Christmas gift-giving gone horribly wrong, and leave it at that.", "This is just like wearing a cheap fleece blanket.  Yes, it has armholes and a pocket but that's the only difference between it and a thin blanket.  It's so huge that I have to fold the arms in half and tie up the bottom so I don't trip on it!  Save the money and  just cover yourself with a blanket while on the couch!", "HORRIBLE- do not buy!!! very very itchy material, not the advertised/pictured sweatshirt material. cheap, flimsy and scratchy. I waited too long to return it and now I can't do anything. Awful product- nothing like the good snuggies I used to have.", "I do like my snggie, because it is cozy and made of highly-flammable material. It is not very convenient, however, if you get up from the couch quite often, because it would mean you have to disrobe and put it back on every time. It serves as a great blanket though!", "I bought this as a gag holiday exchange gift. I couldn't beat the price. When I saw it I wondered why anyone would pay more for this. It's cheap material and super long. Drags everywhere! Granted I'm only 5'3 but still. It does keep you warm I guess. The sleeves are also too long to be practical.", "These were 3/$10 including shipping on woot recently, and at that price are perfect for joke gifts or for keeping you comfortable in a chilly house. They really are thin, cheap quality material, but they do keep you a bit warmer than nothing. All of you people trying to stroll around in this aren't getting the concept I think. I'd never pay $15 for one, but if you see them cheap, you get what you pay for.", "I was looking for a low priced snuggie to travel with and it works! It's warm but thin enough to fold into a carry on bag. Sure it's not super high quality material, but it works. I'm 5ft 5 in and it's plenty big enough. Sleeves are long. And it wraps all around me.", "This is the second Snuggie I purchased for my husband.  He loves it!  Uses it all the time and hand has become a staple item to have while watching a movie.  The fleece is a tad bit on the flimsy side, but overall a great buy.", "I got the camo-pattern because my wife thinks its funny. But she uses it all the time, and loves that she can keep her arms warm while reaching for her drink, or remote, or whatever.", "I think its fien its a gift however the box looked old and worn out Im not sure why its supposed to eb new and looks used BUT its cute and hopefully a gift my niece will like", "Nice Quality & colors the fabric is very cuzy and it does keep you warm and cover up.I will recomend these product the color are nice and bright as they show.", "This was a Christmas present for my teenage daughter.  She was always taking my snuggie, now she has her own. Good quality, and it is being put to good use!", "So disappointed.  They make this look so perfect in the pictures and on TV.  This does not wrap around you.  You walk into it and it's open in the back.  Your back is exposed.  You cannot get up and walk in it because it falls off and is so long that you trip on it unless you are 7 feet tall.  I keep it in my blanket pile and use it like a regular blanket.  I will invest in a fleece bathrobe instead.", "He loves it, doesn't sit in his bean bag chair and read without it. He trips over it as it's adult size, but none the less his dream blanket yay!", "Before the zebra snuggie fleece blanket with sleeves, I was often told things like \"You'll never be good enough\" or \"You're never going to have any friends!\", but once my conversation with my mother was over, I got right on Amazon.com and my life changed forever.  When I put on my reverse bathrobe, I feel like a new man!  My self confidence is at an all time high, I'm basically the most popular kid at school, and now I only get beat up every other day! Kids talk about how cool I am all the time now that I never take off my sleeve blanket...or slanket as urban dictionary has yet to define it. As I be struttin' down the hall wearin' my blankoat or blankie coat, I hear all the cliques sayin' things like \"Does he really shower in it?\" and \"Is it true he wore that thing to prom?\"  Well the answer to both is yes and how awesome can a product be that provides instant popularity and perceived jealousy! I recommend this merchandise to anyone that wants to take the world by storm, you'll even get free black eyes to match at no extra cost! Thank you zebra snuggie fleece blanket for providing the first ever public bathwrap! I'll never be the same again.", "I really needed this for our long winter! It's great! It's so soft and comfortable and warm. Great for using while sitting at my computer.", "Now i do think it's stretch to fly fish in one of these but they are warm and cozy around the house on a night like we have been having.", "I love it! It is very comfortable, big enough, soft and cheap.Perfect for a cold evening at TV or a nap in the afternoon.", "Gave these to my daughter and her boyfriend for Christmas and they loved them, this was one of the things on their wish list.", "this was great for a fun gift exchange. wasn't sure what people would think of it, but it ended up getting a good chuckle.", "It keeps me warm. I love it and use it everyday. I don't relax on my couch without it!! I would recommend this product", "It's a snuggie, what else is there to say? It keeps you warm. The only problem with it, is that I only bought one.", "Sent this to an old friend for xmas. She loved it. Makes a nice inexpensive gift, especially for a senior person.", "This is an ill-fitting, cheap-feeling, not warm absurd product.  If you want to buy it as a joke gift, go for it.  If you want it for what it's advertised for, it'll end up in the trash after your first wearing....", "Pretty cozy & warm and the colors and price of the snuggie were within our budget and something we enjoy using.", "I can keep warm, while protecting my masculinity. I keep it in my office for those unexpected cold office days.", "bought for my daugther she likes it. very warm and the pocket on front is handy. would purchase this again.", "For reasons I cannot get into, but you could probably read on wikileaks, I found myself \"in country\" with this garment.  This garment saved my life. Not only was I able to plant the explosive device at the train crossing, but do so in warmth and comfort!  The insinuating properties help to prevent being picked up by infra-red scanning devices from circling helicopters, but the extra wide sleeves would continue to get entangled in the anti-recoil device of my weapon.", "I am very pleased with my purchase!  It is soft, roomy and I really like the huge pocket in front!!!", "GIFTED!  RECEIVER LOVES IT AND WAS GLAD TO GET ANOTHER ONE.  COULD NOT FIND IN RETAIL! THANKS", "This isn't at all what I expected.  The fleece is very thin and flimsy. I would not buy again", "Snuggie Fleece Blanket with Sleeves is junk.  Material is thin, size is too small for most people and workmanship on product is terrible.  Sorry I bought it.  First time I was ever dissatisfied with a product from Amazon.", "Better off wrapping up in a couple of old towels sewn together with armholes cut out.", "Don't like this item. It's awkward and thin. Not at all what it looks like.", "The fabric is of poor quality and not soft at all. It's a waste of money!", "My Snuggie has solved the problem of cold shoulders and arms that I had when sitting with an ordinary blanket on my lap. The regular blanket would not stay in place when I was crocheting and knitting.  One wrong move and I was cold again.  With the Snuggie I can still do what I want and the Snuggie stays in place.  Sometimes I wear it to bed, then when my husband rolls over I still have my arms and shoulders covered.  I am very glad I purchased it.", "I never thought I'd be one of those people who bought a snuggie, but when I saw my heating bill for one month I realized that wearing a snuggie around the house or when I'm relaxing on the couch would be a more cost-efficient option than keeping my thermostat at 72.  It is a thinner material, but it's suprisingly warm.  The pockets are really handy and the color is bright and fun.  My only complaint is the arms are a little too long.", "Don't waste your money. So thin it's see through.", "I ordered this as a gift. When it arrived and I opened it, to my horror it was a box filled with nothing but packets of Equal sweetener. I contacted Amazon and they took care of the situation right away. I still don't understand the mix up but at least Amazon could fix it.", "i got this as a gift for christmas. it does its job of keeping you warm but all blankets do that. this is like a backwards robe but its hard to keep on when you are standing up, because it barely goes past your shoulders. i guess it is tailored towards people who lay on the couch all day. i tried to wear it like a normal robe but theres not enough cloth. if you stand up with it on a rug it will create static. i pet my dog after walking a few feet and shocked his nose. it attracts dog hair like crazy. there is a pocket on this for some reason.its so impractical unless you are the type of person who lays in bed for more than 20 hours a day and needs to use their hands without getting too cold.", "I bought this as a gift that I was ashamed to give... it is big, but it is also thin and flimsy... poorly made, poor quality material.I cannot see what the fascination with snuggies was... they are terrible - rather buy a blanket or a robe", "In practice, however, this product has some serious flaws.  From the images and packaging it looks like the product is made of a lush velour material, but when you finally tear it open excitedly and make first contact with your skin, it is in fact composed of a type of flexible cardboard with spray on flocking that is highly abrasive, similar to shark's skin or a sheet of fluffy glass shards.  After a few washings in industrial fabric softener it becomes somewhat tolerable, but the material also contains microfibers that permanently abosrb farts and boob sweat and slow feed them into your mouth while you wear it.  Once the \"garment\" has reached critical mass with flatulence absorption, no amount of bleach or chemical solvents will remove the odor.  The only solution is to burn it in a crematorium furnace or submit it with all applicable fees to your county hazardous waste disposal facility.  I gave it two stars, however, because the cheap dye from the camo pattern (which I later found is in fact illegal for use in domestic manufacturing plants) ended up giving me awesome-shaped lesions which to this day impress the ladies at the pub.", "I was looking for a cheap blanket I could take hunting with me to keep the wind off. This blanket works great with the arm holes cut out.  It slips quietly and easily over your head, but does become dirty and tear easily.  It will make it through a couple of seasons.", "This was a present for my grandson. Him and mom like the monkey decor. The great advantage is that they can share the Snuggie with mom when he wears his monkey pijamas while mom snugs. I am very pleased with this choice.", "I purchased this for my wife as one of her Christmas presents and she loves it. Our house is very well insulated and comfortable but, my wife gets chills easily. This Snuggie put an end to that!", "My snuggie came, the package was ripped open already and there was a red stain on three separate parts of my grey snuggle. I am a big snuggie lover and I was severely disappointed in this one.", "I THINK THIS IS A RIP OFF DUE TO IT BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO REALLY MOVE IN AT ALL.  I WOULD PREFER A PLAIN BLANKET. UNFORTUNATELY I PURCHASED 2 AND IT WAS SALVATION ARMY...COULDN'T GIVE THEM AWAY.", "PurchasedThis to use around my home, it worked out great, it's big and fluffy with pockets, warmToo .. I really loved the print on it as well.. You won't find itIn stores.", "This thing is perfect for sitting around in your favorite overstuffed leather chair.  It seems to make you feel a comfortable warmth without becoming overly warm or smothered like a quilt.", "Pleasant and fluffy. Similar to a bathrobe in its feeling of comfort, but opposite to a bathrobe in that you cannot really wear it around the house all day. Which is a plus to my mind.", "My granddaughter wanted a snuggie for Christmas and I was looking for one that was full size but that would be cute for a pre-teen. This one was great and it was nice and soft as well.", "Very thin and cheap. It was a Christmas present for a kid, and since they waned it so badly I'll probably have to sew an extra layer to it, to make it an actual functioning thing....", "Kind of thin and cheap.", "The price was perfect for this product, as it was a bit of a gag gift for my husband at our wedding. The snuggie shipped fast and was in perfect condition, and in the original box.", "Yes, they look stupid. No, I would not wear it while fishing (like the picture shows on the box). However I do have to admit that I use this about three times a week watching TV.", "This is very thin fleece and the plaid pattern is blurry on mine. It doesn't look nice like the picture. It's very staticky too. But I love the pockets and it is nice and warm.", "I bought two Snuggie Fleece Blankets for my young granddaughters and they love them.  Now we are warm and cuddly when we all watch their DVDs.... eating popcorn is easy.  ;)", "Snuggies are great if you can get pass feeling a little silly wearing them at first.  I bought this one for my husband.  He's a grump and won't use it.  I think its great.", "First of all this is a front loading garment.  Sort of like a straight jacket.  Also it does not have enough material to cover your backside.  'One Size Fits All' my eye.", "love my snuggie I just wish they made it in the microplush version. a little on the thin side but still great. gotta love the camoflauge to keep my man hood together lol.", "It took longer to receive the item than expected, and it wasnt the one I orginally wanted to buy, but the new owner of this snuggy loves it and that is all that matters.", "Thank you, the package arrived on said date and even though the packaging was a bit busted up the content inside seems fine and looks of nice quality. Thanks again! :)", "Our son wanted one of these for playing video games.  One of the few designs that actually don't look odd worn by a boy.  Not bad quality for the price.  Great deal.", "Arrived quickly and well packaged. I rally like it even though it is a little bulky. But most one size fits all items are a little large on the adverage size person.", "I originally had bought this and another item for a friend for Christmas, yet it was so warm and cozy that I decided to get them something else and keep the snuggle.", "I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she is loving it!!!!  She wanted the adult size so that she would have extra to wrap around her and it was perfect.", "Bought it as a present for my youngest sister who stands at 5'. It was about 5 inches long for her but she likes it and the design is good and not cheap-looking.", "What more can I say?  I mean a Snuggie with monkeys all over it and pockets!  So far it is holding up well and my wife seems to like lounging in it to stay warm.", "This is a great product, especially this model with the pockets.  Easy to wash, once size fits EVERYONE (this thing is huge!) and did I mention the pockets? ;)", "Awesome product, I would recommend it to anyone. Great gift for any occasion! Very warm, and its light enough that it can be used during any time of the year.", "So basically all I got was a really thin blanket that had arm holes in them. I would not recommend buying this Unless you want it be cold and short 25 bucks.", "Love it! The colors, softness, & warmth! Would definitely recommend it!If you are looking for warmth, but still be able to use your hands, this is it!", "I love my snuggie. It's soft and so comfy.  The front pocket is great for holding your cell phone or whatever.  Finally I can be warm and still use my arms.", "I like the idea of a sleeved blanket but the material is a little thin.  Arm holes are also too big and a little too long.  Too far with one size fits all.", "I purchased this as a gift for my friend whom always wanted one. This snuggie is super soft and comfy! The design is also adorable, and my friend loved it!", "For the price this is an amazing product. Very soft and very useful. My wife and I now have about 3 of these and they always withstand the test of time.", "I love this! I bought this for myself for work and its great. My office building gets really cold and this is nice to use while working on the computer", "got this for a birthday gift for my wife, she LOVES it!! she's only 5'4\" so it fits her perfectly to where she can cover her whole body up with it.", "The product came quick and with no damage! I can be nice and warm now! There was nothing wrong with it, i just thought the quality could be better...", "Got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it! It kept him warm. The sleeves makes it easy to do things without taking the blanket off of him.", "bought this item for viewing tv and playing xbox in the basement where it is cooler.  love it.  provides the flexibility needed yet keeps you warm", "I bought this for my daughter's eleventh birthday and she LOVES IT!!!  She wears it around the house and sleeps in it every night.Great Buy!!!", "Got this as a gift for a friend. She loved it, quality is the same as any other snuggie, design is cool and different. Great price for a present.", "It was not what I expected ,I thought it was very flimsy.I would not buy another one.Very,very disappointed.what more can I say.that says it all.", "My teenage son loves this item.  He loves the camoflouage colors and uses it constantly.  He can play his video games and still stay bundled up.", "This was a gift, and the person loved it very much, and the pocket is a great perk. He was very excited to get it and plans on using it forever.", "My daughter wanted a snuggie but all we could find was sports teams. Ordered this and she uses it frequently.  Good quality and adorable print.", "Cheaply made and way too thin. Doesn't keep you warm. I was hoping it would have a zipper at the bottom, but it didn't. What a waste of money!", "The Snuggie fleece is not as good as I would have liked. It's too thin. It keeps me fairly warm. They just don't make them like they used too.", "Our granma is always cold.  Even when its 100 degrees outside.  We got this for her since we can't take 85 degrees in the house like she does!", "My daughter loves having her snuggie to keep her warm on the cold nights and mornings. She likes the design and the softness of the material.", "I bought this as a gift. My daughter's friend loves monkeys and this fit her perfectly. The colors are bright and the monkey faces are cute.", "I just wished the sleeves for the snuggie so big. I also wish it opened in the front & that you could close it with something like Velcro", "I am a \"Blankie-A-Holic\"! I love blankets of all sizes and fabrics <well maybe not all fabics!> and this Snuggie is awesome!Talk about SOFT! There isn't one square inch that isn't soft!OK this Snuggie is long. For those complainers - I 'd rather have too long then not long enough! I use this when I get up at 4 am in the morning to do my work on the computer. It's usually cold at that time of morning. I usually sit on the couch with my little table/computer, so it's really nice to have a blanket that has sleeves. I can actually use my arms/hands to type and not get angry when the blanket gets so heavy on my arms that I toss it off. Nope - this is perfect! I can cover up and have free use of my arms/hands at all times. I am kept quite warm indeed!For those who compared this Snuggie to cardboard - ARE YOU SERIOUS? <by the way - your review is pathetic> LOL Wow - that's amazing to me. This has to be the softest thing I've ever felt. It may not be super thick or \"lush velour\" <BY THE WAY - READ DESCRIPTIONS as it states in the header it's \"FLEECE\"> but this is the most comfortable blanket I've ever purchased - and I have a ton of them. And for those who complain there's no velcro to attach it to wow - it's a BLANKET! Blankets WRAP around you!!And as far as pilling goes - if you're more worried about how long you've had a blanket because of how much pilling you have on said blanket - you have issues. Pilling does NOT affect how well the blanket will retain heat unless you've never washed the blanket and it's been 10 years and every square centimeter is covered in pills!!!READ DESCRIPTIONS PEOPLE!! IT STATES IT'S \"SUPER LARGE\" AND THE SLEEVES ARE \"OVER-SIZED\", AND IT'S FLEECE!People - this is a TWENTY DOLLAR blanket with sleeves AND pockets- not a diamond!This Snuggie - at least MY Snuggie is large enough to wrap around me, keep me warm and comfy as I do some work on my computer. I don't need 2 blankets - one to wrap around me and another to go over my arms. It's long enough so that when I am laying down -  it covers me completely, and when I'm sitting up - well it covers me completely. My husband is 6'2/250 and it covers him completely and he loves it. I also got one for my brother in law who is also a blanket freak and he's 6'0/350 and he absolutely loves it. I am 5'8/175 and LOVE MY SNUGGIE. I also love the pockets - just another added benefit of a Snuggie!In my honest opinion - WORTH EVERY PENNY!", "Nice , soft and comfy .As strange as this may sound I bought this for one of my cats. I had one that was very similar and they would both fight over who was going to curl up on it. So one finally claimed it and the other was so upset about it I decided to get another one for the other cat to keep the peace. This worked out well . Both cats have a zebra snuggie and there is a little more peace around my home.", "You know those fleece blankets that are always on sale at Rite Aid at the end of an isle? That's what the Snuggie feels like, but it has sleeves and it's HUGE!It makes for a hilarious gag gift, but in reality you'll find yourself using it. It's basically a robe you put on backwards, and though I've never done anything productive in it, it's super nice for taking a nap on the couch while watching TV or playing Angry Birds on the iPad or something equally rigorous.I don't understand any of the negative reviews regarding quality, the ones I've ordered have consistently been a thick enough sturdy fabric.So yeah, it's a blanket...with sleeves!", "I ordered this because when I sitting and on my laptop, this is lightweight but warm. and its easy to take my arms out if I get to warm, and my little dog likes it cause he can be covered up on my lap too...its a win win  :) :)", "I got this as a gag gift for my husband. I didn't have much expectations for it, just more for the laugh factor. It is a bit thin so can rip easily. I'd say it's ok for lounging around the house, but won't keep you warm if you take it on a camping trip or to the drive in movies.", "If you're expecting a cheaply made ream of inexpensive fabric with sleeves sewn into it then you won't be disappointed. That's what I expected and that's what I received. If you're expecting a lovingly, handcrafted, quality garment that you will one day bequeath as a family heirloom to your great grandchildren you might feel a bit let down.It is what it is...a novelty gift to give to someone you don't want to spend a lot of money on.", "My husband loves this Snuggie!  My only qualm is that it was sent to us in a transparent package, so my husband saw his silly Christmas gift early, and he rolled his eyes at me.  It would've been much more fun if it had been sent in normal packaging instead of a transparent bag.  The quality is awesome, and it's held up through several washes, two kids and a dog and cat, along with my rough husband.  We often use it in the car for the toddler in the carseat when it's cold outside. I love Snuggies, and we own several!", "The item is apparently exactly what I ordered, however I am disappointed with the quality of the Snuggie in general. I was expecting more of a blanket quality of material. Instead, I received what is basically felt material sown together. The poor quality of the material does not do a sufficient job at keeping you warm, nor is it long enough to put on and stretch out on the couch. I am not a tall person (only 5'5\"), yet my feet still stick out from the end. The Snuggie is definitely not worth all the hype it received a few years ago.", "I sent this to my daughter for sleep away camp. She was thrilled to get it and slept with it every night. It is not very thick, but it is soft inside and stays on well on the arms so you do not have to keep pulling it up. I gave it a four star rating only because it is rather thin.", "I purchased this for my step-father and he LOVE IT! I bought one for myself (blue) and love it too. My only complaint is not having come up with the idea... I'm apparently not very creative.It's not overly warm but it's warm enough for watching TV, etc. Note that it's extremely big! My step-father is 5'10\" and he has to either hold it up like a long shirt or walk backwards to move around in it (both of those things are hilarious so if anything, it gets extra stars for the comedy factor). He had always made fun of Snuggies before I got him one and now he uses it everyday! He noted it would be perfect if it has a hood but other than that, it's great!Great gift for guys/girls/everyone!", "I was surprised by the flimsy fleece-like fabric.  Within 3 days, one arm hole seam has torn. It is soft and reasonable warm once seated.", "I gave it to my dad as a Christmas present, he is a former marine and it cracked him up. It was a successful gift and fit perfectly fine.", "He loves it although he wears it backwards (like a robe) which cracks us all up.I'm a little surprised he actually uses it all the time!", "Great for keeping warm during sex, It's much more enjoyable experience, especially when dry. My only requests is to add a semen sweeper", "My son needed and loved this for laying around pondering his navel.Anyhow, very comfortable.Not heavy, but does the trick.", "I haven't washed it yet but, thus far, it's warm and cozy! It's my second one. The first seemed thicker but this one does the trick ;)", "Product is well loved. But the order was wrong. I wanted the purple one not the blue one. Luckily my niece is flexible and adores it.", "We love Snuggies and get them every year for the holidays. Very comfortable! If you've never tried one, it's time to take the plunge.", "It's a Snuggie! Great price,  even if it is the Varsity style. My fiance didn't take the XXL on the front to heart,  so that's nice.", "It was an exciting color but I just didn't like th material it was made with. It was kind of like getting an ugly Christmas sweater.", "Purchased as a joke gift however my niece fell in love with it. She says it keeps her nice and warm against the air conditioning.", "Great product-It was well made, color was beautiful- as shown-soft, comfortable, and great quality as well as a reasonable price.", "Snuggie was as described - very nice and masculine for my husband while watching TV - warm and comfortable.  He really likes it.", "Getting exactly what you expect. Comes in original Snuggie packaging, the exact one as advertised, and all the snuggie comfort", "Exactly as described quick arrival.  It was priced well.  There really isn't much more to add here.  I would order this again", "I bought this thinking it was the deluxe/luxurious version. I passed it along to a friend who wanted a snuggie. Cute design.", "looks tacky but it's super warm and really if you're buying a snuggie you're not trying to be fashionable let's be real here", "This thing is freaking comfy! It nice and thick enough to keep me warm. It's also long enough to cover me way past my feet.", "Seems thin, but MUCH WARMER than expected.  VERY NICE! And VERY MUCH APPRECIATED for keeping cold away. Big enough for two.", "My older daughter got a snuggie a couple of years back and my youngest instantly decided she wanted one too.  She loves it!", "I like the snuggie it keeps me warm and I have sleeves to have my hand free to do things with like grab a drink or a snack", "You don't need me to leave a review about the Snuggie everybody knows they're awesome so go ahead and get one for yourself", "Left lint balls ......I ask all of family members from out-of state and they too were freaked out about the residual lint.", "I bought this Snuggie for my grandson. It Is perfect for reading or watching TV, it is lightweight but warm. He loves it.", "My daughter loves blankets and soft things she can snuggle in.  This was perfect and what she asked for. She loves it!", "It was for my puppy, he has had one since he first came home, he loves it, he was very glad to see he had another one.", "This snuggie is priced right for a great value. It is a little thin but, even so, does a good job of keeping you warm.", "I bought this for my son for his birthday, he's 31 and he loved it! It's soft and comfortable and he loves the skulls.", "Makes a great gift for the right type of person. There's not much more to say - it's a Snuggie, for crying out loud...", "This is a most awkward item. It's quite cumbersome. It is warm though. I would not recommend this product to a friend.", "For the price its well worth it. My husband enjoys turning down the thermostat and staying comfortable in the snuggie", "Provides warmth without weight. I may have to get another one because everyone,  including the cats, wants to use it.", "Got this as a gift for my MIL. Matched her home decor, and was a hit. Faster shipment than estimated. Very satisfied.", "Very happy with the product! Works great exactly as described. Going to order it again too. Very pleased too. Great!", "Terrible quality, does not feel nice! However I have not tried it so not sure if it keeps you warm. Tons of static.", "My brothers and I wear these when we play xbox, watch tv, read or just hang out. Great for staying warm and cozy!", "my grandson wanted this particular snuggie for over 2 years - I was thrilled to find it and he is a very happy boy", "I returned this because it was much cheaper in person than it appeared in the picture.  I was disappointed in it.", "Got for my girl, who loves it, though she wishes it had a matching belt for when she gets and walks around in it.", "Like the arm feature but thin material doesn't provide a lot of warmth, I should have gotten something heavier .", "I love the snuggie but this one is very thin and not nearly as soft as my previous snuggie. Poor quality fabric.", "Received this product and it wasn't what I thought it would be. Very poor quality. But you get what you pay for.", "The snuggle isn't super thick or heavy. Its a little disappointing. It is cute how it looks like a sweatshirt.", "This Snuggie is very soft. I also like the length because I can wrap the extra length around me to keep warm.", "My son bought this for his grandma this is good could be better if it had a snap or velcro to close the back", "This is perfect.  It looks and feels wonderful.  I am so glad I chose it.  It made a perfect Christmas gift.", "it kept me warm and cozy during the harsh cold winter that we had.  I am glad I spent the money that I did.", "Keeps body heat in, keeps the breeze out. Sit next to the window or fan on a cool day, you'll never notice.", "it must have been a return .. it had a light burn/rub mark near the shoulder .. other than that it is comfy", "I've never had one before.  It was very comfortable, more than I expected for the price. I'm glad I got it.", "My boyfriend loves his snuggie. He is always cold and this was the perfect solution. I also like the color.", "purchased this for a gag gift, who doesn't love a snuggie though, especially with a skull and cross bones!", "this blanket is the best. we use them everywhere we go. take them Camping or to the beach, they are great.", "Purchased it for my dad, but he seldom uses it. Wish I'd kept it for myself. My cousin uses it, loves it.", "It is perfect for late night reading in bed with the heat turned down. Wish I had gotten one before this.", "Warm and cozey.  Cool camoflauge to match my sons while we watch tv on those cold nights.  He loves them.", "Very cute! Was Chistmas present & her room has a monkey theme.  She was surprised it had monkeys on it.", "This doesn't have a belt which is disappointing because it is so big but it is comfy cozy to curl up in", "Very comfy and it fits very well. This is perfect for at work, as it has been pretty chilly. Thank you!", "awesome for the price quality item . this was a gift for someone that just had surgery and he loved it", "Very comfy. Wish there were more design /logo options. But in the end, we're not showing off with it.", "The product  looks warm and snugly on tv, but the fabric is so slight, it's useless in any real cold.", "We got it for our daughter. She finds it a little bit large to use properly but it is so toasty warm.", "I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. One size fits all. Cozy, soft, lightweight.", "it looked like someone had washed it 50 times.  not a fan of the open back too.  poor product design", "very comfy and the pockets makes it very practical.  I use it to watch TV and when I work from home", "The material is real thin fleece but cut fairly generously.  But the boss lady says it works well!", "Good deal and made for a great gift. I would probably keep this in mind for the next gift as well.", "She loves her Snuggie, takes it to school in the week and the weekends bring it home. good . good", "product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use", "I bought this for my adult son for Christmas, he uses it every evening and says that he loves it.", "Snuggie's are not that great.

I would buy it again and again and again and twice more.", "My wife is very happy with it and when she is happy I am happy. Love the color and material.", "I purchased the fleece blanket as a Christmas gift and the receipant has really enjoyed it.", "it was a Christmas present for my eleven year old son he loves it and wears it all the time", "He loves it for warmth and we don't have to have it so hot in the room while we watch TV.", "I have got it for my son in law. He is tall man and this blanket fits him just perfect.", "Bought as a gift for my Dad and he loves it.  Keeps him warm and was a great price too.", "Thin, not soft at all.

I returned it with no problem.", "Item delivered on time and as described, love that it has sleeves and pockets!", "Bought this for a co-worker that is always cold in our office. She loves it!", "A smidge on the thin side by hubby likes it.  Nice and long.  He's 6'1\".", "What a piece of crap.  Guess that is what you can expect for a snuggy.  lol", "Wish Snuggie had more coverage on back. Vendor was great, product is okay.", "Nice color in gray. Launders well. Long length to cover up completely.", "Its nice to have but you can't really walk around with this thing on.", "It was fabulous, but the pattern I ordered was not what was shipped.", "mother in law  likes it but not as worm as she thought it would be!", "I bought this snuggie for my boyfriend. His sister owns one (a good quality and it is not a slankiet). Since he always was stealing one from her, I decided to get him his own. This Snuggie?! Its cheap quality. Box destroyed, and it seems as it was previously used. Really? If I knew, I would have bought him something else. Now, I am embarrassed to give it to him, a cheap quality snuggie. Thank you very much seller for selling people reused cheap stuff.", "Just not really what I expected and its so long and made real cheap ,I just kept it so I don't have to pay return shipping but it really is just a piece of junk to be honest with you...I would recommend to pass on this unless you really have money to waste cause that's pretty much exactly what it is ,,a big waste of cash ..!!!!...wish I could have giving it no stars so don't be confused its less than a star ......so buy something else this item is garbage ...thanks", "Awesome snuggie..love the new pocket design...and its very warm!", "I just received the Snuggie and I have to say that I am very disappointed.  I thought it would be much softer and fluffier but it was not.  It's a fairly thin fabric which was very disappointing.  I think I'm going to return it  and look for something softer and warmer.", "I like the product. Still, I find an issue: you can't close it on the back and you can't walk around the house with it. The fabric and the pattern are good, but they should find a way to close the back and allow you to move around with it.", "My dad loves this. I think he particularly likes the camo print. This one even has pockets! The price is also definitely right. The thickness is perfect for chilly Georgia evenings in front of the TV.", "She bought it thinking she would feel more sporty in it because of the varsity logo. lol. Not so much. However it is really large and very comfy. Not as warm as a sweatshirt, but can do in a cool atmosphere.", "Maybe I had higher hopes but I really wanted this to be more plush than we received. It's rather thin for fleece and while it worked fine for us, I'm not sure I'd buy another. Three stars for a great idea, lost two for the quality of material.", "Please note this does NOT seal on the back. That being said it does it's job well. It's job? keeping me warm while I play my videogames!! I love the camo, it's nice and soft, and the sleeves are genius! I used to make fun of snuggies, but they really are worth it!", "Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  Amazon had them for $13.00, so it was a no-brainer.  At that amazing price I bought them for my nephews as well.  My kid loves it because she can snuggle in it on the couch and have her hands free for her cell phone.  That's huge for her (rolls eyes).", "First off, I have to say when i opened the box and felt the fabric I was a little disappointed since it was slightly rough on the outside, kinda like the look of when you wash some fleece but it doesn't feel soft anymore! But when i actually used it, the inside was very soft and very comfortable! It was pretty warm too, not super hot like a comforter but good enough for lounging and relaxing in front of the tv! Very big so it covered me up without any part of me showing, but not too big that it limited my movement. Great product, would love to get another for my whole family to use!", "I was surprised at how thin the material of this thing is. You can hold it up and actually see through it in places. When you look closely at it, you can see that much of it doesn't even have any fleece attached to the backing material. CHEAP.", "My god finally a full body blanket, do you guys know how long i have been waiting for something like this every time i get out of bed i freeze my ass off having to leave the warmth of blankets. But with the snoogie i can finally leave the comforts of my bed and stay warm, it has seriously changed my life never again do i have to face the chilling cold of my attic and never again do i have to suffer the blistering freeze of the sub-temperature floor. with my new snoogie im protected from the harsh freezing winds i can just lay down practically and be warmth comfort all day. I especially love it when im sitting at my computer all day typing up papers for my classes it really motivates to get down to work unlike before where i dreaded having to sit in the cold small computer room for hour next to a window to get my school work done. i seriously recommend this product to others it will change the way you guys live as well, and i hope that no one else has to suffer that same way i had to, before i discovered the snoogie.", "it was great for the horrible winter that we had\u2026.kept us warm", "Had to return it since mother in law did'nt like the print :(", "Just what I was searching for, fast receipt from Amazon, too.", "My wife loves her snuggy. She curls up with it every evening", "Awesome product, great price. Would recommend this item.", "Very thin fleece; neither plush nor exceptionally warm.", "It's smaller than I thought and is extremely thin.", "The box looked like it was used as a soccer ball.", "Christmas present for grand daughter.  Loves it.", "bought as a gift and keeps you warm and snuggly", "This was a Christmas present and the recepiant was very pleased and that pleased me.  It arrived in perfect condition and exceeded my expectations.", "bought two of these for working in the winter (I work from home).Only complaint is that the fabric is the cheaper fleece.  Cotton is usually the only fabric that I can wear for long periods of time, so that is really a personal complaint.It is warm and it is large enough -- I am a large person.", "Wife loves it! Soft, large, and accurate pattern to the picture. Peace signs weren't our favorite pattern, but it stays on the couch and isn't outdoor wear, so it's fine. Just wish more patterns were available through prime!", "My aunt gave me this snuggy a couple of years ago as a gift and I have been fond of this blanket ever since because it is truly warm, soft, comfy and convenient.  Bought one recently for my husband so he would stop taking mine.", "I got this to use at work. With this cold of a winter the office just would not warm up. This is NOT a \"true\" blanket. I would call the weight more close to a bathrobe. Light weight but warm.Would I purchase another one - yes. It does what I wanted it to do, keep me warm, but not too hot.", "Bought two of these for Christmas for gag gifts.  Ended up sending one back as I didn't attend the party where the gag gift was needed.  The recipient of the one Snuggie totally loved it and put it on and wore it around the party.  Of course he is a hunter and thinks the gift was great and thinks he will get a lot of use out of it.", "My wife likes it, sure, but we've only had it for two days and the stitching is already coming loose on the arms and pockets. Instead of securing the stitching, it looks like the manufacturer's equipment bundled a chunk of thread on the seam and bunched it up. It literally wasn't secured on either arm. Very unimpressed.", "better quality then the other Snuggie we have but not as long as the other and this one needs to be. Works in the guest room. Much cheaper than a robe. He didnt use it for watch TV as I thought he would.", "What can I say, it's a thin fleece blanket with sleeves. That's what I expected and that's what I got. Mind you, I'm 5' 5\" and tripping all over this thing and the sleeves are way long so there's plenty of material to fit people much taller than me. Now, depending on your girth, this may not be the case.", "Snuggies are so tacky and ugly (especially with peace signs all over them), but I love mine so much.  I tend to roll around when I sleep and I end up kicking off all my blankets only to wake up too early shivering.  With the snuggie, I can't really kick off anything because my arms are in the sleeves.", "The fleece on this product is quite nice.  It's the second Snuggie that I've had.  The first one lasted a few years until the fleece started falling out, as expected for fleece.  Then you know it's time to buy a new one.  At less than $12, this is a bargain and quite useful.  PEACE & OUT!!!", "I bought this for my 11 year old for Christmas.  He absolutely loves it.  Wears it all over the house.  As for durability, time will tell.  But he was pretty happy with it at Christmas and he is still using it.  That is more than I can say for some of this other gifts.", "Purchased two of these, and they work fine if you're sitting down, but the second you sit up or get up even slightly they fall right off because the back of this blanket is wide open and there is no way to secure it to your body.", "If you love the color green and being warm and cozy in the winter this is the product for you. Remember its open in the back so if you sit on an upright chair you'll be exposed but otherwise this works great.", "I've heard people say that all I had to do was try a Snuggie and I would be sold.  Well I bought it for my sister and it was exactly what I had imagined.  A fleece blanket with awkward to use arm holes.  The blanket will not stay wrapped around you if you move around.  You must stay in bed.  A simple but effective solution would have been to add a little fleece strap so that you could tie it around your back.  It is a very lightweight fabric which will barely keep you warm.  The only cool aspect of the blanket was the design.  Which I have to admit is eye-pleasing.  It also allows one to get attached to the blanket since it's like your personal stamp.  My sister fell in love with the peace sign blanket.  Whenever I see the blanket draped over a couch or chair I can't help but be reminded of her.  It's an over-priced fleece blanket.  If you're looking for value look elsewhere; but overall it's not that bad.  I mean you are paying $15-20 for a fleece blanket with holes and that's pretty much what you get.  I guess the important thing is that my sister is happy and your giftee will probably be too (that is unless they're frugal).", "Shipping was fast, product was just as expected.  Got this for a hospital stay I knew I had coming up, I got so many compliments on it.  It was just the right thickness to keep me warm but not hot!  Super soft.", "My husband and I love it. It is softer than the ones I bought in the store. I have not washed it yet but I am hoping it will be fine. It is the perfect weight too. So far I bought 3 of them.  We use these everyday. My cats love them too", "This is a great idea and a good buy! It was well worth my money. Although it is quite staticy and large, it keeps me warm as I am always cold! Great for plane rides, car trips, and cold winter nights. Its unbelievably cozy and warm!! I recommend this for anyone who is cold a lot and likes to try fun things.", "I ordered this snuggie with sleeves as a gift!  Despite the heat is on in our condo, my friend loves it.Great customer service and fast shipping.I would recommend this blanket to anyone who would feel chilly or cold at home.", "I bought this during the winter months, but cover up with it in the evenings as I am watching TV. I love it and take it with me when I go on trips. I would also love the child size one but cannot find anymore of them. I have 1 that I purchased at walmart on sale,in a disney print, and altho its shorter its good for summer. I love them both.", "I got this for my sister who lives in Ohio.  With their brutal winter and power outages she was having trouble keeping warm.  She wears this over a couple of layers of clothes, but she is happy to have it.", "My wife is very sensitive to the cold and was resorting to many short blankets while she is at home. So I thought a snuggie will work for her. And I also want this for this upcoming winter.The size is perfect for both of us (I'm 6'3\") and keeps us warm. This is our first snuggie and the price was the best deal. We suggest washing it once before using it because they might smell like the storage area.", "IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND NEW FOR A GIFT, THIS IS AND EXCELENT OPTION!!MY GIRLFRIND LOVE IT!", "This is not as great as the advertisement makes it out to be.  There is no velcro or any way to attach it while its on so the snuggie is constantly falling off and is excessively long.  Needs alterations definitely if you want it to work better.  I attached a piece of velcro at the back of the neck to keep it from falling down.  I need to hem it also.  I understand it's made for OSFA so they leave extra fabric to accommodate all sized people. I wouldn't recommend this product to a friend.", "It does the job but I would have loved this snuggie if it had any weight to it.  It's made of very cheap, VERY THIN material. These might work for people down south but here in Michigan we need warm blankets with sleeves.", "Bought it as a gift for a teenager and she loves it! Prompt delivery,and well packaged. Only Snuggies was able to find in the stores during the holiday were the Hello Kitty and NFL ones, so was great to find this! Thank you!", "The perfect blanket! Soft and warm, this is ideal for winter. I used to have a bit of an issue walking around as the bottom would drag along the floor but I just tied it around my waist high enough to prevent this.Just a tip, I know it's picture like a blanket draped in front of you with arms but I like to do it the completely opposite way. I put the main part around my back, stick my arms through, and tie the front. It's my robe during the day and my blanket at night!", "Let's start of this review by saying that this product does exactly what it says it will do. However I personally believe that it is over priced for the quality of what you receive making it a poor value. The fabric is probably the lightest weight plush available and is see-through. If you can see through it, the wind will pass through it. So I can imagine at home, indoors, while sitting on the sofa watching TV, this is a decent blanket but outdoors in the cold...NOT.", "I bought this for work as I am always cold and my legs are just as cold as my top. The biggest issue is there is no belt or closure. Granted, I am sure this is not meant to be brought into an office I know of other \"Snuggie\" like products that do offer some form of closure. Other than that, it is fine.", "This product is cheap.  The stitching is not even.  The fleece is cheap and will certainly pill after a couple of washes.  The cloud pattern is totally ridiculous, but that is a perk in my book.It keeps my arms and hands warm while I'm using a computer or watching tv on the couch.  The flaps in the back are long enough to overlap and keep my back warm.  The sleeves are nice and long, so I can pull them down over my hands when I want to.  I even nap on the couch wearing this.  Sometimes it's actually too warm, which is amazing because I'm perpetually cold.  My husband used to tease me for wearing this.  Then one night, when he was sick, he tried it on and loved it.Could I make my own that was nicer quality?  Yes.  But I'm not when I can buy one for $14.", "I railed against this idea for so long, but I'm always reading on the couch and my arms would get cold! Bought this for myself, and my husband uses it too (although he's on a laptop). It's a little too big (super long and wide), but I love the pockets and the fleece is really soft.", "i bought the army design....its nice i just hoped they put a string at the back so it wont leave the back open. it will fall off your shoulders once you stand and move around...i throw it on the washer but it has to be washed separately..didnt dare to put it onthe dryer...wont buy again..", "I bought this for my boyfriend as one of his Christmas presents.  He bought me a cheetah print snuggie last year and I love it!  Unfortunately, this snuggie I bought for him is a lot more thin and not as soft as the one he purchased me which I found odd.  Not sure if they cheapened the material in the past year, but this certainly wasn't like the one he gave to me...which of course was disappointing.", "It's nice and cozy which I guess was the main point. It's just awkwardly cut and to walk around in it is a tripping hazard. It's too long in the front and lacking in the back, kinda reminds me of a hospital gown--leaving your backside exposed. If it at least had a belt or something it would be a little more controllable.", "Awesome secret santa or gift exchange item, not really recommended for adults as no one will want to use it in front of others :-P (but I can't mark down a product which clearly conveys the pattern on the listing)", "I already have a snuggie and even my dog but my boyfriend felt too manly to have one. But he's been getting cold as we sit and watch TV and not moving around. I showed him the camo one and he changed his mind. He really likes it. It's nice and warm and comfortable. It even has pockets which mine didn't.", "6 years ago, my little sister gave me a zebra snuggie for Christmas.  She thought that was the best gift ever and obviously what I was missing in my life. I faked excitement, since she is 20 years younger than I am, but lo an behold, I ended up using the heck out of this thing! I even washed it repeatedly and it is still as soft as ever an looks nice (no little bumps that sometimes form on sweats-like stuff and colors are still solid and in high contrast).I usually use it with the opening in the front and drag it like a royal robe on the floor if I need to walk somewhere. I love how light it is, the wizard sleeves and the excessive (I'm 5'1) length that lets me wrap it around my legs from behind. I think the only thing that would make this snuggie more awesome is a hood.", "My husband enjoys it but thank goodness he isn't into products for appearance just functionality. I was disappointed when I got it in the mail it defiantly wasn't as nice as the picture. It was some what faded and I have heard story's of the lettering coming off. The letters haven't came of yet but it looks like they will any time.", "cheap. cheap. cheap.  poor quality materials.  very thin.  pocket on front is super small (kid sized hands will fit).  washed it three times to get rid of the smell of the material (no luck) and a small hole appeared in the middle toward the bottom.  still haven't worn it yet and don't plan on it.", "I'm pretty happy with the end product but since I live in Australia it took a while for the item to come.I ordered this mid-November and only received it a couple of weeks ago. I decided to finally chase up i-Parcel and apparantly the seller didn't correctly describe the item when selling so it got held in Australian Quarantine for over a month!!! But come on guys, all I wanted was a blanket not something people suspect to be drugs...This was a group gift for one of my best friend's birthday so I was very disappointed about the wait, if it was for myself I wouldn't have minded so much. Apparantly if I didn't chase it up it'd still be in quarantine. Like c'mon after Christmas was beyond a joke.But anyway when it eventually arrived I couldn't give it to her straight away because I had things to do at home so I didn't want to review this until she got it and opened it.When she got it though it was well worth the wait, the look and her face when she realised what it was was awesome. No she isn't a nerd, she's just always wanted a Snuggie.So yeah if there wasn't a wait I'd give it 5 stars and if my friend didn't love it so much I would've given it 2 stars so that's my verdict on it.", "I have always been apprehensive to buy a snuggie. But I loved the look of this one and finally broke down and bought it.  I love it! So warm and soft.  The only thing I wish it had was a clasp or button in the back to hold it up. Otherwise, fabulous!", "This is a good standard Snuggie. I think since these things have been out for awhile the price should come down a little. The only reason I purchased it in the first place is because my dad was dying to have one for winter and I adored the pattern. I would not pay this price again. The shipper of this item obviously had this for a very long time because the box was very dusty, taped up, and smelled like smoke or stale air.", "I always joke with my parents about how I'm going to get them a Snuggie, so I did! For Christmas, I bought this for my stepfather and he loved it! It opens at the back and you slip in, then you patch it back up in the back! Plus these are the colors of his favorite football team!", "It's like this was a cheap knock-off. The fabric is thin, the seams were coming loose right out of the box (which was pretty worn when it came in), and the letters began to wash off the first wash (washing directions were followed). Don't waste your money like I did, even if it is as an \"ironic joke.\"", "I would have never purchased a camoflauge Snuggie for myself, but my husband specifically requested it for the cold Afghani nights while on his deployment, and he loves it! It got here fast, in plenty of time for me to ship it to him with the rest of his Christmas presents.", "The people in the commercials always looked a little like cult members to me. But the one with skulls on it? Had to buy for my wife (who made fun of the commercials right along with me). She loves it. Comfortable, easy to wash. Nice.", "The product was sent as described. And, while the snuggie itself was undamaged, the original box had been damaged (it is no longer in a box shape, there are many dents, the top does not even close). I had been planning to give this snuggie to someone as a gift and am disappointed that I won't be able to use the original box. But, like said, the product itself is undamaged.", "I wish there were snaps or velcro or something to keep it from falling off of them. The kids want to wear it around and play in it but its just as difficult to keep in around them as it is to keep a simple blanket around their shoulders.", "My Snuggie was nothing like I thought it would be.  Did not cover me fully. seemed more like a huge throw to wrap around my body.  I thought it was something I could put over my head and be fully covered and snuggled in.  But instead this was like a bathrobe without a belt that I couldn't keep snugged around me.  I was very disappointed :(", "I just love this product it keeps me warm while letting me read or be on my computer it is a nice product. the only con i have is the back stays open there is no button to close it or anything but that is a minor drawback i really dont bother with the back i just love this product, I would recommend this for people to buy", "bought it as a gift, and found the price really reasonable. the product was more lightweight than I thought it would be but keeps you surprisingly warm. was actually looking for a different solid color or pattern, but in the end the price of the product won out, I thought it would have a football team on it, but the team on it says, \"snuggie\" which is just fine. I had actually hoped that the product was able to be used reversibly but it is a front worn product only.Over all I'm happy with the product and found it to be a fantastic gift with the given being happy with the product as well", "Low quality fleece. It's still pretty cozy lying down on the couch but the arm slots are not functionally very helpful because it's open in the back and doesn't stay on well while standing up.  It might work better for a large person though.", "I was given 2 Snuggies for Christmas last year and they are very warm and comfortable however after just 2 washes the fleece started pilling. For those out there that are unschooled in the differences in fleece, pretty much every fleece in the world is soft and warm to begin with. One of the biggest differences between high quality and low quality fleece lies in the \"pilling effect\". Pilling occurs when the garment's fibers roll up, often after being washed, and lie on the surface like tiny round pills. This pilling seriously effects almost every aspect of the fleece including how it feels, how it looks, and its ability to keep heat in. All fleece pills eventually. You can tell how old a Patagonia Synchilla jacket is based off of how much pilling has taken place. Basically pilling takes a considerable amount time with high quality fleece while cheap fleece starts to pill right away, usually after just 1 or 2 washes. I had serious pilling after just 2 washes with the Snuggies and I am now over 30 washes with my Slankets and they still haven't shown even the slightest sign of pilling yet. For those that are unaware, Slankets are really the original sleeved blankets that came out roughly a year before Snuggies. Slankets are more expensive but its worth it as they use a much higher quality fleece.The bottom line - Snuggies are cheaper but you get what you pay for. A Slanket costs more but its going to have a significantly longer lifespan than the Snuggie and it will keep its softness and its ability to keep in warmth much longer than the Snuggie. I gave my Snuggies to the Salvation Army and purchased 4 Slankets. My advice is to spend a little more and get a sleeved blanket that is considerably higher in quality. If you care more about saving money than actually buying something of quality then maybe the Snuggie is for you after all.2 stars", "It is very thin.  I was expecting a warmer and heavier fabric.  The sizing is odd, way too long but not wide enough.  I am not short or over weight.  I never use it.  It does not keep me warm", "I sent this as a gift to my cousin who lives up north .  I thought it would be great due to the bad weather they have been having.  I have one of these myself.  She just loved it.  She said it was so soft and comfortable, which I already knew.  It also remains very soft even after being washed several times. It is also a one size only, and so affordable.", "I love this Snuggie's design! And the Snuggie itself is comfy and warm. The sleeves are great for hands-free relaxation. Some might say this is a stupid thing to buy because it's just like a backwards robe, but really this covers you up better than just wearing a backwards robe. If you like to snuggle then the Snuggie is perfect for you or as a gift", "I also bought this for my brother, it's too funny! I got this for about six bucks cheaper than list price with shipping, so of course I had to get it. It's really big though, even on me (i'm 5'8) it looks like a dress! He can shuffle around with it though, its cute. :)", "purchased as a gift.  the recipient seems to like it, although it is much thinner than a fleece sweatshirt would be.  it's about as thick as an average t-shirt with the feel of fleece.  if it doesn't have to be \"Snuggie\", go with any 'blanket with sleeves' that may be thicker instead.", "Bought several years ago at Big Lot's for $5.00 that should tell you something. Bought as emergency gift just to have. Sat on shelf for a very long time. Glad did not ever give as gift. The material is very thin, very flimsy and sleeves big, would have been embarrassed if I had given as gift. Decided to try myself one cold day as I was watching television and was pleasantly surprised!  It kept me warm. Material may be thin but it is soft and does keep you warm. Glad I bought.", "Definitely would not recommend due to the fact that your entire back is basically out so you can't move around with it unless you don't mind it falling off every 3 steps.

But that may be a good thing. This is the blanket you want. I own several blankets, and this has become my number one. I love it. Dense material, will not 'pill'. It produces Zero Lint. Not meant for Summer-use. It's like being wrapped up in your favorite hoodie. Easy to wash, and it will last for a decade or more. Just buy it.", "This is the warmest and coziest blanket we have ever purchased. We really put it to the test early, as had only this blanket for our bed during the cold winter temps (10 degrees) we recently had.  We had just moved and our comforter for our bed had not arrived yet.  However, with just this blanket on our bed, we felt like we had our down comforter  as well.  The nice thing about the blanket, besides being warm, is that it's not bulky. We feel like we are at a 5 star hotel with this luxurious blanket on our  bed and you can't beat the price. We  bought the brown one, but they offer other great colors as well.Very happy and highly recommended!", "I love this blanket. It is so soft and the size is perfect. No new blanket odor at all. Its a generous queen size.  It washed up with beautifully.  It has nice body to it but is a thinner type blanket.  Perfect for spring  summer or fall. Not sure about winter.  Probably would need an additional blanket in the winter.  But the best of all is the price. I felt that i got a great blanket esp for the price", "Bought this blanket for when we go motorcycle camping.  We pull a bunk house which is a pop-up camper.  We needed a light weight blanket to have for those warm/cool nights where you just need a bit of something. Our other planned use is if it gets cold we can put this blanket under the sheet and throw the sleeping bag on top.  And we should stay very comfortable that way.The blanket washed beautifully.  It is so soft and for what we needed, it is perfect.So if you need a light weight soft fleece blanket...this could be the perfect choice for you.", "Absolutely the best for the price!  First night of taking a nap before work almost missed work napping.  Extremely soft WARM.  Don't let the price and thinness fool you.

He is always cold so I am sure this extra blanket I bought him will help him be more comfortable.", "I purchased this for my grandson.  When he received the blanket, he called me and asked what color did I order?  I told him brown (which is what the picture showed).  He told me that what they received was Basil Green.  He is happy with the color and said that it is really warm.  I think that they need to have better pictures of the colors and full names of the colors.", "A few days ago I had run across these blankets while amazon shopping. I had originally ordered a twin size as a throw blanket to keep me warm while lying on my bed watching TV. When it arrived I was impressed with the quality and softness. I ended up putting it on my full size bed. My bed must be a small full or the blanket large for a twin, anyhow it fit. Still  I needed one for a throw blanket so I ordered another one. Love these blankets and should I need more will definitely order again. Wonderful colors to choose from as well. Very satisfied with this purchase.", "I bought this to use as a couch cover to protect against pet hair/gross. It's a really nice thick blanket and the dimensions were 100% accurate so it worked as planned. It's very soft and comfy to lay on for people and pets.It does have a slight plastic smell when opened but hanging it up for 15 minutes took care of that.", "I bought a king sze because my husband usually hogs all the blankets at night (we usually have a queen sze blanket).

Perfect for the couch and perfect for late night game sessions in my recliner. I am not sharing this blanket with my wife or my cats. I buy another one. Great value.", "For me it is a nice blanket for what I was looking for. Needed a blanket that was not to heavy and more on the light side and this is working out great! Was thinking of 4 stars because I wash the blanket a lot and the seems have a little threads starting to come undone but for the how many times I have washed it do not see this being a big deal to me! Seem to be holding up well so far.", "This is a very nice light weight blanket.  The only reason I gave it a four is because the color looks more like army green.  I was hoping for more green. I washed this blanket and it turned out great.  Still looks good.", "This thing is WARM!!! and comfortable.  I bought the turd brown one and it seems to be great. The only reason I deducted a star is because it seems a bit static(y), but I have no regrets.Great price!Warm!Comfortable!", "Very, very soft blanket and exceptional value for the wonderful price. The color is perfect and the quality appears to be excellent. I purchased these for my son, and judging by the first washing experience, I think they will hold up nicely.", "Love this blanket- really soft and cozy, perfect to snuggle up in.

Was in Walmart yesterday and there was one for $19.99 that was 3 times the weight and softness. I wrongfully assumed the one I was getting was at least equal to that. That's the problem with mail order, sometimes you get burned. On the other hand their cotton blankets are a solid 5 star!", "The blankets arrived on the day promised and had the appearance, weight and feel that I expected. They appear to be durable, but I have had them for just a short time so can't speak for their construction.", "I wanted an inexpensive blanket to put on top of my bedspread as our two Weimaraners sleep with us. This does the trick as it must be washed weekly and is working out well. The blanket is super soft and went through the wash well.", "My daughter's new dog (puppy) threatened to ruin here nice bedding.

What more can you ask for?", "My wife has had to sleep in a recliner due to rib injury,  Ordered her this blanket as we had no other spares.  She was a little leery, thought it might not be warm enough.  After the first night she was sold.  This blanket was the right size and was plenty warm.  We had no heat for a couple of nights but she stayed warm and toasty.  May have to buy another just to have a spare.", "I bought 2 twin size to cover up two new recliners, since we have pets.

Only washed once, so I don't know yet, how they'll hold up to repeated washing, but I'm hopeful.", "It's huge, but doesn't keep me warm unless I have a blanket under it like my comforter or regular blanket. I live in LA so it doesn't get too cold here compared to other places but this blanket is useless without another underneath. I was sooooo cold when I tried to use this on it's own.", "This is a thin and warm blanket I got the king for my queen size bed I like my blanket big and this deliveredI would say that it is for function not style I use it daily as my only blanket but would be perfect for put away in closet for guest and whatnot folds away and stacks well", "I bought 2 of these to create a floor-to-ceiling room partition.  They are okay, though nothing great or special.  I only went with this brand because it was the only one that is sized bigger (90x95 instead of 90x90).  The problems I have with these blankets are:1)  Stinks like chemicals and a musty campground.  It's a very unusual smell that hasn't gone away even after washing and hanging outside on a clothes line.  I'm starting to wonder how long they will take to off-gas.  My entire 15x25 ft. space now smells like these blankets.  :(2)  On the thin side.  I don't think these will work very well for keeping cold air out because they're so thin.  Hopefully I'm wrong about that, but won't know until winter comes around again.3)  I would *never* want to sleep under one of these.  They are definitely not \"soft and fluffy\" as I saw described by some reviewers.  They just don't feel good on my skin.  I have other polar fleece blankets that are indeed soft and fluffy, so I do have something to compare these new blankets with.4)  Poor workmanship.  Sadly, right where I made an entrance for my partition, the seam on the side of one blanket is screwed up.  It looks pretty bad.  You get what you pay for, apparently.I would *not* recommend these blankets for indoor living.  I would only recommend them for camping in the fall or spring--and only then after they've been washed several times.", "very soft, I ordered it cause I needed a throw for over my chair, and its perfect!  Nice and soft and when the cold weather hits and I can pull it off and cover up with it.  Yes I would order another for my bed!", "Very comfortable.  The fleece is pretty thick.  I've only washed it once, but it came out fine.  I read reviews for other fleece blankets that stated they were as thin as aircraft blankets and had holes after one time in the washer.Not this blanket.  I expect to have this for many years to come.", "It is correctly described.  I find it reasonably warm and great to use on the couch for a nap.  I haven't washed it yet, but I can't see that being an issue.  As the picture indicates, the nap is very short.  A good product at a very good (I pd 16) price.", "I love how soft and warm this blanket is! I can wrap it around myself and not need to turn on the heater. My apartment gets pretty cold (I live in central Washington), so this was a good investment. The queen size is big enough to cover myself and my boyfriend, even when we're sitting in chairs 2 feet apart.", "At first I thought it was a little too light weight but after covering myself I find it is perfect for my needs.

Blanket is extremely thin fleece. Very poor quality After 3 weeks, the blanket has worn to the point that it has a hole in it.  You get what you pay for.  Blankets should me made to hold up.

Bought the queen size for a queen size bed with a thick mattress, and there is plenty of extra to keep things tucked in and neat.", "Bought the chocolate queen to replace our duvet in the summer. Perfect weight (light) and texture. Soft but not plush. I prefer it to the more plush Calvin Klein blankets we picked up at Costco. No lint shedding.

I would not display this blanket in my living room, yet it is functional.", "I use this blanket as a dog bed and my pup seems to like it alot. I didn't want to spend $100+ on a bed and it seems like everything below that price point is too thin or poorly made to be of much use. I fold this blanket 4 times and it fits nicely in the dog crate and keeps him warm and comfy.", "I would order this again.  It is being used to cover my back seat of my car.  I simply don't want those expensive car bench covers.  Holes were slit so that the belt buckle could be inserted.  This is a nice alternative and my dog now can seat in the back without messing it up too much.", "Just a great blanket for staying warm on cold nights. Inexpensively priced and high quality that holds up well in the wash.

They are very hard to find.  I finally found this one on Amazon and it is great.

It's not extremely thick but I wasn't looking for anything really thick.", "Much softer and more comfortable than expected considering the price. Got even softer after machine washing with no problems. The most inexpensive blanket so far and love it!!! Will purchase in other colors!", "although these are very warm, they are not the soft feel of blanket I would have purchased at a store. I think I got what I paid for and thats it.

It's super soft and warm as an additional winter blanket under our duvet.  As others have stated, it did not lose much lint in the dryer after the first wash...However, I'm only rating it 4 stars because the size/shape is very strange.  I ordered the king blanket for our king size bed and instead of being more square like you'd expect, it's significantly longer in one direction...Like, extremely long. When put on the bed the long way side-to-side, it hangs over the edge on both sides by at least 2 feet. When put on the bed the long way top to bottom it's barely wide enough to cover the mattress (overhang of maybe 2 inches per side) and has a solid 3 feet on blanket that gets tucked under the mattress at the foot of the bed.Not sure what's going on here with the size but for $22 I can't be too upset...", "Not quite as soft as I expected. I would equate it to a utility type of blanket, it's functional. The blanket is warm enough for me, and my dog seems to enjoy sleeping on it.

I normally just use a sheet and bedspread most of the year.  But because I like to sleep in a cool room, I shut off the vents in the bedroom and like to keep the door closed to the bedroom so it is very cool, almost cold, for good sleeping conditions.  This thermal blanket is quite light and will hardly be noticed weight-wise, but will provide the body heat I will want to keep my toes and feet from being cold.  It is just right for that and will be put on the bed in another month or so.  We washed it and have it all ready to go.  Light and comfortable.  Warm enough but not hot enough to disrupt good sleeping conditions.", "I was leery about the low price and some very negative reviews, but this blanket is exactly what I was looking for.  It is very soft and the king size drapes perfectly about a regular king size bed (spread over a down comforter/cover that has seen better days).  The Basil color is very similar to an army blanket but it the texture is visibly more inviting.  It feels great to lay on top of as well as very cozy to sleep under.  I have washed it twice: once immediately before putting on the bed; once after my daughter threw up on it.  It came out perfectly both time with no pilling.", "neither fish nor fowl, this blanket is not quite a wind breaker and not quite a liner. It is thin, but extermely durable. It is certanly queen size. This is the kind of material one comes to love, but do not expect a fluffy self sufficient item for the deep cold. I like it, and for the price it is worth it simply as material itself.. Also, you can probably pass it on through the generations because I do not see it ever tearing.", "Worth the price of admission. Blanket is singe ply so warmth is satisfactory and cant be used alone. I live in the northeast so in combination with a quilt you can probably bundle up nicely for a winter night. Works best on a fall evening to get the chill off.I cant speak to washing it since it's so new. Like I said, it's the price that counts here.Fit is good. no problems there.I would buy again as an additional guest bedroom blanket.", "These are nice, soft blankets. I use them to cover the fabric on my couches because I have two dogs. They cling to the fabric well so that they do not slide off, and are large enough to cover the fabric of a full size couch and have leftover to tuck in edges. I can lift blanket off and no dog hair underneath, so company does not end up with fur coat.", "Awesome fleece blanket I waited awhile to write a review to make sure I really liked it I don't like I love it I am very cold natured and it keeps me nice and warm at night and added plus is it's so lite weight I don't like any heavy covers on me", "I like blankets. I like to lay on them while the eagles take it easy and bob seger faces the promise. Yes. Looking at the sun until I go blind I wonder where the beef is. WHO STRAIGHTENED THE TOWELS?!? I bought this on a double dog dare and I couldn't be more excited when it arrived already opened from the friendly ups man who thinks that I think he's cute, he smiles at my from the side of mouth which I always wondered the thought he carried in his head when he notices my address on his \"to do\" list but I digress. I burned the blanket when it arrived as a sacrifice to the gods of old in hopes I would fall backwards into money, fame and several ladies who didn't mind the size of my manhood but I digress (again) but then again I forgot what I was digressing about but I digress...again (this time with feeling). Buy thisHere's what others had to say about this product!jjj5: I ordered several of this then smuggled them in my butt when I got convicted of third degree murder, then I emptied my butt into the community toilet, tied them  together and crawled down to freedom. I'm on the run but I do have wi-fi.kkk5: I love the fleece! I feel like I'm one of Jason's Astronaughts!", "Washed the blanket when it was delivered and it came out of the dryer beautifully.  It is a bit thinner than I anticipated - but very soft!  It will be perfect under a comforter during the cold winter and without a comforter for fall.", "I bought this for my parents who needed a lightweight blanket that was \"not too hot and not too cold\" for spring and summer weather.  They love it. They had previously rejected a summer-weight comforter and a thin satin blanket. I can't elaborate on its qualities since I'm not the one using it, but I will say that it was quite a lot nicer than I was expecting for the price.", "Just what we needed, a soft warm blanket, and generously sized for a queen-sized bed.  The fleece is great put underneath other blankets, as the texture of the fleece helps hold everything else in place.  Nice blanket at a good price.  Thanks Utopia!", "This blanket arrived quickly, was packaged nicely, and is a gorgeous olive/moss green color. It's soft, lightweight, and much like the blankets I've seen in fine hotels. It fits our guest bed perfectly and kept our guest warm on a cold winter night. I would definitely buy this product again.", "This blanket is large; soft; warm for temperate climates and a beautiful color of green!  I was surprised at the size of the blanket. I ordered a twin and it was wide enough to lay across a double bed. I washed it upon arrival in a front loader on gentle and it didn't pill.  I used it as a travel blanket and packed it by squeezing the air out and sealing it somewhat with a food sealer. It was still about 24\" long, 6\" wide and 3\" high, folded and squished as small as I could get it.  It's a good lightweight (in warmth and physical weight) blanket/throw.  If you wanted something to cover you in a hammock for travel, I'd think you could cut this in half and hem the edge for two blankets.  It's a good length.", "I got two Queen sizes, one in tan. The tan is beautiful . I was hesitant to get these according to the price, thought the quality wouldn't be good but I was very surprised ( they arrived in three days). I took them out and felt the texture which is very soft and warm, no odor !!!. I may get a few more for some relatives as gifts. Can't go wrong for the price.", "I bought 2 of these twin sized blankets in Basil.  They were promptly sent out and received.  The color is very nice - a warm green that coordinates well with other decor.  The size is very good - not skimpy.  The best part - they are very soft, warm and comfortable.  I am well-pleased with my new fleece blankets and the service I received.  Thanks!", "Not soft at all! And causes so much static no matter what the weather. I HATE IT. Not even worth returning. I use it as a dog blanket.", "Love the colour, love the size,it is cozy and ideal for cold evenings while reading a good book...it's not super soft as some might expect but for the price, this blanket  is really great deal.The colour is identical to the one on the photos.", "We really like this blanket. It is very soft and keeps me warm and cozy when I sleep. I also like the fact that it fits the bed nicely. We actually have plenty of blanket on both sides of the bed to keep us covered, which is a plus. All in all, it is a very nice blanket at a very good price.", "This blanket was a great buy. I got it for camping, and it was exactly what I needed. I was worried that it would feel cheap and light based on the price, but when I received it I was pleasantly surprised. It has a good weight to it, and has a quality feel. Has no issues keeping me warm at night.", "This blanket is perfect for me.  It is not too thin or too thick.  It also washes and dries very well.  There is not as much fuzz in the dryer as other similar  blankets I have.  There is absolutely no pilling after three washes.  I think it is an exception value  for the price.  The material is very strong.  My dog shares this  blanket with me.  Other blankets have gotten holes from the dog's nails.", "We really love this super-soft, warm, and pretty blanket. The color has stayed true through several washing, it doesn't pull or pill, and it's not awkwardly bulky or heavy. I like that it's generously sized, and hangs nicely over the mattress. No more tug-of-war for the covers during the night! We don't need anything but a sheet with this blanket, even when it's freezing out and out house temp is around 64. Our cats seem to adore it more than any other bedding we've had...two paws up.", "I love the color, the feel and texture and I will be buying more colors very soon.  My Mother wants me to order for her now, she loves the feel and texture too.", "Great quality, a nice light blanket for the warm weather, while still able to keep you warm on chilly nights. Shipping was on time, product was in great condition. Price was a bargain. Couldn't ask for more.", "Product was delivered shortly after I placed my order. Product is as described - warm, good quality and light weight.  I live in Alaska and bought 2 blankets for two sets of visitors from warmer states who  visited me early this summer. I wanted to make sure they are comfortable.", "This blanket is a very nice, medium weight, perfect for a chilly evening but not so heavy that you can't sleep under it.  We are using this in our camper under the comforter on our queen bed and are quite pleased with it.  It is not the super-soft fleece I expected, but it is just right for the bed, more like the underside of a comfortable sweatshirt.  The color is a nice, rich brown.", "For the price this is a great blanket. The fleece is soft, thick and doesn't have that gross cheap feeling that some fleece blankets do. I got the gray for a twin bed in my daughter's pink and gray room. Warm and cozy. She loves snuggling beneath her blankets", "I love this blanket we use it instead of a comforter it's really warm a little too warm since it's been hot out but it'll be perfect for the winter it's huge I have a king bed so I got a king size and a queen could've fit the bed but all in all a great blanket!", "No, it's not super warm. It's just warm. The one from LLBean is super warm. But also costs four times more and we weren't as ready for that as we were earlier in life. This blanket is of a nice fleece, not that creepy material some are made of that we saw at Target (we live a no-Walm... life) and the price was right. Edges are finished nicely. Have not had it in washer&dryer; yet; that'll of course be the real test of its quality. Just need to get it dirty first, which will hopefully take a year, unless we take it camping.", "I ordered the queen size blankets for a twin size bed. It fits perfect. It's lightweight and perfect under a quilt and will be nice for summer. I haven't washed it yet so I don't know about shrinkage.", "It's really nice and soft and we like it. I've only washed it once so far and it came out just fine, just like new but being that it hasn't had much use and I haven't given it the second wash yet I can't say how well it will hold up. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars as opposed to 5. As a matter of fact, we are about to move north where we will have more use time for the blanket and I plan to purchase more of these. Then I should be able to give more input about them and will do so.", "it's exactly what I wanted.  thin, lightweight, warm.  it feels a little micro-fiber-ish (like one of those cleaning washcloth sized things) on my hairy legs but it's not really that bad and I got used to it pretty quick.  it remains to be seen how well it cleans and handles being dirty.  seller provided quick and simple service.", "First off - this was a very nice blanket - so I'm keeping it...but it wasn't what I ordered.  I ordered their \"Chocolate\" colored blanket, which looks like a color closer to my couch...what I received was the \"Tan\" blanket.  ....though the label/barcode on the package clearly says \"Choco\" as the color, when you compare the pictures it's obviously the lighter of the brown colors available.  So I'm not sure if that's a quality control issue with the manufacture, the seller or Amazon...but I wouldn't place a second order for fear of getting the wrong color item.  With that said - of 3 blankets I've recently ordered, it's the most durable, had almost no shedding after the first wash and if I knew i could get the right color - I'd happily reorder again.  For now it's a good match for my spare bedroom decor and a guest I've had staying over recent has made positive comments about the warmth and softness of the blanket.  ...5-stars if only I could have gotten the right color...", "This has been a a very cold winter in New England and I am happy to say that the Utopia fleece blanket that I order has keep us warm and is not heavy on you. I have not wash it and am hoping that it will not lose it shape,if it wash will I will purchase a couple of more for spare beds in our house.", "It wasn't noticed till we had it on one of the beds, a 3\"x 3\" stain.These beds are in spare rooms and no one had slept in this room and I had just put them on the beds for the first time.  I tried to wash it out but what ever it was would not come out with a few different stain removers. After the washing we then noticed the material was pilling. It was too much bother to send it back. They are now lying in the trunk of my car for emergency use.This item doesn't warrant even 1 star.", "Very soft and warm.  It's perfect for what I need which is a blanket to be on top on my bed that is easy to wash, since my dog spends lots of time there.  It does pill a fair amount, but that hasn't been much of a problem.", "Love the feel of this blanket...soft but not the squishy \" plush\" blankets you see everywhere that are flimsy and have no density to them. I prefer not to use a comforter for sleeping so this is perfect for me most of the year. Someone commented that it does not breath ... but I'll tell you compared to my comforters it breathes well", "My husband is always freezing at night.  We went from 5-6 blankets on the bed to him needing just this one!  It is so soft and warm. It was priced great too! The grey color fits perfectly with our decor, and I will be ordering another one for everyone to use when hanging out in the basement!", "Nice and soft. Enough coverage for winter and usually sleep without during summer (I get hot quickly) well worth the price. Purchased the king size and it's just a little too small to cover the edges fully so I flipped it and had it fully cover the sides of the bed and stops about an inch short of the top of the mattress.", "I love this blanket!  Great price, very soft, not too thick, and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again if it came in my favorite light blue color (hint, hint!)  Seriously, get this blanket if you want a light-weight blanket that is made well.", "Exactly what I was looking for as I did not want a plush fleece for use as a sofa cover.  The color is lighter than shown in the picture and that also was a plus.  Have washed it once and it washes beautifully.", "Like many of the less expensive blankets on amazon I had heard of large amounts of shedding and lint from other products. After the first wash had a few lint balls and after the second wash only found one. Is on the thin side but i live in a warm area so not a problem and it is very soft.", "I totally appreciate a lightweight blanket with heavyweight warmth. I mean...WOW! Great blanket!! I highly recommend it for anyone with not enough storage space for a big thick comforter/blanket but wants something warm for guests...or maybe even for themselves on a chilly night.", "This grey king-size blanket is perfect for what I wanted:  something very lightweight, yet warm, in a neutral color.  As some reviewers have noted, the grey is lighter than apparently pictured on most screens, however, that suited me fine.", "The blanket is nice and soft and warm and will cover all of me (tall guy).The only con I've noticed is that if I drool on my arm, I am unable to wipe off all the cold drool I wake up to. I end up having to use another blanket.", "The blanket was better quality than I had expected!It was a gift and the recipient has said how warm and soft the blanket is.I will definitely buy from this seller again.I would like to see a bigger selection of colors to choose from.", "I have an ultra soft plush blanket now that feels wonderful but is too heavy for summer.  I thought this one might be a thinner lighter version but it is still too much for summer.  It is kind of stiff, even after washing, and not all that soft.  Not soft like fleece.  More like felt.  It came in a nice plastic zipper bag with a handle so it is going in the trunk to spread out at the beach or the park.", "I was very happy that I'd found the blanket I was looking for under $20.  But when I opened the package the blanket smelled so bad that I couldn't keep it indoors.  I laundered it quickly hoping the stench would evaporate, but alas it was just as stinky as before.  I even left it on a chair on my balcony overnight, but that didn't do the job either.  I'm still waiting for the smell to go away so I can use it!!", "I love this blanket. It is soft, just as promised, and warm. Just thick enough without being too heavy. It arrived before the deadline given and was well packaged for shipping. The color,basil, is exactly as pictured.", "I love this blanket. It is soft, just as promised, and warm. Just thick enough without being too heavy. It arrived before the deadline given and was well packaged for shipping.

I haven't washed it, but it appears durable. I may order another.", "Can exactly as described.  very soft and very big.  Actually using this to cover an extra wide recliner chair made of microfiber to protect the fabric from my dog who things the chair belongs to her!  Much better coverage and less expensive that dog covers.", "SO WARM! I have a twin bed but ordered a queen because I wanted to be able to double it up. I've used it when the room I was staying in was in the forties and I was still very toasty.", "Soft and warm. Perfect for snuggling up in. Great quality; doesn't feel cheap. My only complaint would be that it is a bit big for a twin size...but it's not much of a complaint. Would order again if desired in a different color.", "This is an OK blanket, but it's made in China and NOT American-made polar fleece as I thought. My bad, I guess. turns out polar fleece is a more generic term than I thought. For about $20 with shipping, it's reasonably priced and should work fine for me.", "So cheap and so nice. I get really hot a night so I use this as a comforter on my queen size bed. Washed and dried it many times and it still looks the same.", "Blanket has been good so far. It is warm and pretty heavyweight. It is not super-soft, but it is also not very harsh. I think that it is a solid blanket for the money. I've been using it as a base layer to keep the thermostat a bit lower at night with a quilt on top, and it has done a much better job at keeping me warm than the fleece blanket it replaced.", "", "For context: I'm a very hot sleeper. In my new place the radiator is close to my bed and it doesn't stay on throughout the day/night. I found that this blanket has a really nice weight to it, but it doesn't make me hot like a regular down comforter. It's not the best if it get's >50, but I've been enjoying the benefits of layers so it is the perfect \"base\" blanket. I haven't washed it yet but I don't see any potential issues of washing cold and drying on a regular heat cycle, but I will update this post once I finally do that.", "I purchased these to cover & protect a new, odd size couch from dog hair and drool.  They're doing the trick, as well as being soft and cozy for  both man and beast.  I actually just bought 2 more to use on another couch.", "ok so I bought my sister one.  she loved it so ...I bought my good friend one...  she loved it also..  then I said to myself why am I not buying myself one?  so I did!this blanket is soft, light in feel but keeps me quite warm,  It washes well.  no pilling or shrinking. I wish there were more colors but I have my eye on a second color that would be nice on my other bed..  somebody stop me!..  I will soon be the Polar Fleece Queen!", "This is an excellent low-cost blanket. I washed it immediately, of course, using delicate cold and a low dry, per the instructions. The result was very little lint on the lint screen, no pilling, and a blanket looked just as it did before going into the washer. It is soft and light yet it sleeps warm. So why only four stars? Because the color is not chocolate as described. Milk chocolate, perhaps, although it's a little light even for that description. I suggested golden brown; my wife said \"mouse brown.\" Mouse brown means nothing to me as mice (in the wild) vary from light to dark brown; however, I'm not a \"color person\" and she is, so her description may carry meaning for other color persons.", "I have used this blanket for approximately one month. It washes/dries well with very little shedding, is light weight, warm, good sized, and very reasonably priced. I am very pleased with my purchase. The only minor suggestion I could make would be to have 1 side with a larger hem or binding so one can tell where the head of the bed is which would help in bed making. I would recommend this product.", "I ordered two of these blankets....one tan and one green.  The colors are soft and attractive.  But what I like best is that these blankets truly are warm.  I had another blanket on my  bed that looked like it would be a nice warm one when I bought it but it is not.  These blankets provide the warmth I was seeking and they are not heavy.  I'm most appreciative to have found these at my favorite shopping spot on the web.", "This blanket is cheap! No matter how many times you wash, there is fuzz everywhere.. it is pretty ridiculous. Just save your money and get a better blanket. This is good for throwing over the couch or what have you.. or just give it to your dog. You get what you pay for.", "I have at least three of these in kings to tuck over my sofa so my dogs don't mess it up.  When it's cold (not too often in Phoenix) I use another to cozy up with...they are light weight, wash very well, no pilling (which I LOATHE).

Haven't had any real cool weather yet but pretty confident it will be good.", "I was hoping this was a high end product at a deep discount.  It wasn't.  It reminded me of a softer version of steel wool, made of cheap material.  For the price it was sold,  that would make sense.  You get what you pay for.  It may be warm and all, but I returned it since it was cheap and not extra soft as advertised.", "Super comfy!  Looks like good quality stitching as well. Definitely warm, and perfect for this New England weather.", "Cozy, good fit.

The debris and particles take over your place in less than a day. The hairs stick to your sheets, your feet and into your mouth.I had very expensive navy sheets which I had to throw out. The washing machine could not even remove the fur. DO NOT BUY IT.", "very pleased with this blanket....just what the season needed.....live in Tennessee", "The blankets are soft and warm, just right for our Alabama winters, not to heavy.", "I've had this blanket for a couple months now, and it really holds up nicely! It's a large blanket perfect for a single sized bed. It may seem thin, but the fleece is really good at insulating and maintaining the warmth. Not a great idea to have this as your only blanket, especially during late-Fall to early Winter, so make sure you double up on blankets! Overall a great purchase.", "Just as expected...soft, oversized, warm and comfy.  I definitely recommend it.", "The thickness & weight was just right. The warmth was perfect for cold nights.", "It does its job which is what I wanted Warm me up after a cold night.

Great blanket with a great price tag delivered in perfect condition in a very quick time.", "THE BEST BLANKET I EVER HAD and it hasn't shedded and is so warm along with my comforter, no need for the heater on full blast at all", "Very nice product!", "I found this blanket to be somewhat itchy and not very soft. I was hoping it would be fluffy, but it is quite compacted and firm.", "Awesome for the price!  Not quite sure why there are negative reviews of it not being soft.  Very soft and very warm. Great buy!!", "Pleasantly suprised by the quality of the blanket. Soft, odor free and so large that it covers the mattress and the box springs.", "MOST COMFORTABLE, SOFT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WARM BLANKET EVER!!!!!! MAY HAVE TO ORDER A FEW MORE....EXTREMELY SATISFIED!!!!!!!!", "It is awesome!! Plush, so soft, comfortable and warm. Just the right size for wrapping up on the couch or using it on a bed.", "This was a gift for someone, and they were very happy with the feel and weight of this blanket. I would purchase this again.", "Great big warm blanket for the recliner.  This thing is going to be great to have this winter. And you can't beat the price!", "Great product.. Light, but warm without bulk.  Fits my California King mattress with room to spare. And a bargain, to boot!", "The blanket is soft and comfortable.  I have washed this blanket several times, and it retains its softness.  Great buy!", "I will give the blanket itself 4 stars .... expected them to be a bit softer but they washed nicely so I'm satisfied.", "A little on the light side but plenty warm and soft.  Decent quality for a china made blanket.  Well worth the price.", "These are incredibly warm and also light weight.I can see myself using this during the summer season as well!", "Well packaged high quality blanket shipped promptly and, oh yeah, very warm and comfy... what more could you ask?", "Very warm fleece blanket! I haven't washed yet, but ran it through my dryer, didn't seem to leave too much lint.", "A gift for my boyfriend who is 6ft + and never has a blanket that fits his whole frame.

Soft, true to color and warm. Nothing negative to report on this product.", "Cozy and warm. Soft to the touch. Doesn't shed or have any smell. This is a great buy for a warm blanket.", "Very warm blanket. Definitely worth the money. Would definitely recommend your company to all my friends.", "I love this blanket!  I bought a Queen-size one for my bed.  It washed and dried beautifully (I'm one of those weird people who like to wash items before I use them when I can).  I washed it by itself using my regular detergent on delicate cycle in cold water, and dried on low.  So cozy soft and warm.  And it doesn't feel heavy on me.  I highly recommend!", "this blanket... trust me, buy it. Don't trust me? Enjoy your blanket that isn't warm enough, cozy enough, and capable of keeping you both cool in hot temperatures and warm in the cold ones.... Particularly in wild summers with cold mornings...I love this thing. Thank you Utopia Bedding.", "This bedding was on a wish list for an organization on a Navajo Reservation.  The items on these lists are chosen with a good deal of research and forethought.  Because of this, I purchased this bedding for the organization which was trying to provide good, well-made, soft bedding for the elders on the reservation.  In fact, I have purchased this particular item more than once for these elders.  Utopia Bedding has a very good reputation and I will continue to purchase this bedding for as long as it is needed.  I recommend this bedding to anyone who wants good, reliable, well-made bedding.", "I have this same blanket in 80% real wool and one can feel the difference.  So for the $8.00 additional I paid for that I recommend getting the 80% real wool one.Having said that, this is still a very warm and nice blanket in a true dark olive color.  I do recommend it for the price.", "The color is as shown and the blanket washed up beautifully without filling my dryer's lint filter with lint. However, it looks like the blanket isn't terribly cat-friendly. Little claws make for pilling . . . which I suppose it to be expected. The blanket is soft and warm and is every bit as big as described. So far, so good.", "Initial review- I will update if things change as I use itLOVE this thing. Large enough for a King bed. Soft, warm, and still light & thin. Excellent price for a really good fleece blanket. Time will tell how well it wears, but as for the initial purchase, I'm happy.", "Very Nice quality. Soft and comfortable. I washed it before using it and hardly any lint showed up in the dryer lint catcher - that's a great sign. It is not too thin yet not too bulky either, which serves my purpose to use it under a comforter on a guest bed. I think my guests will love it too and may just have to curl up in it, since it is so nice :0)  It was great price for the size (king) too. After a nightmare experience with a blanket from bbb I am grateful for this one.", "This was not at all what I expected.  It's very thin and not warm at all.  I live in Ohio and this just won't do for our weather.  It is soft and after one washing on gentle I did have lint  in my dryer.  Also after putting it on the bed I found some of the lint on my floor...not good.", "When I ordered this there was no reviews, so I was worried.  Like many of the less expensive blankets on amazon I had heard of large amounts of shedding and lint from other products.  After the first wash had a few lint balls and after the second wash only found one.  Is on the thin side but i live in a warm area  so not a problem and it is very soft.", "Very soft and light weight.I would not count on staying warm while camping with this, but if you added it as a liner inside a bag, I think you'd be super comfy.Just as a blanket for guests or an extra on your bed, it's perfect!! Good spare blanket or three season use (not winter).Another review by Rick's wife :-)", "Super soft, really nice texture and nice fit! It washes and drys well with no fad or piles. Recommend!!!", "The blanket is exactly as described. It does the job it was intended to do at a very reasonable price.", "Warm, toasty, lightweight, washes easily, and, best of all, exactly as advertised. Highly recommended.", "This blanket is so warm and very comfortable. Looking forward to using it to keep warm this winter.", "Awesome blanket.  Very warm and soft for how thin it is.  Definitely a great buy.  Thanks, Amazon!", "It is nice and soft. I've not yet used but apparently looks it will be good for not so cold time.", "Love this blanket!  Soft and warm and the sizing was perfect (fits our Cal. King bed just right).", "super soft, very warm and washed well.  I bought the brown and the color is nice like chocolate.", "Great blanket", "I couldnt wait to test drive it. Its everything I hoped for. Arrived earlier than expecred to.", "It was nice... as expected.  Neither too thin nor too thick but just right to fit under a bed spread at this time of year.UPdate on this blanket...  Finally got it put on the bed.  Nice and lightweight, didn't crush down on my arthritic toes.  Lovely color.  Found it quite warm on our first really cold night.  Up to 4 stars from 3 now that I have used it.", "Very soft, warm, and of nice quality.  This blanket covers my king size bed very well.  I ordered it for one of our spare bedrooms that my 84-year-old mother sleeps in while she is visiting.  I believe that this blanket will keep her plenty warm.  It arrived on time.  I will be ordering at least one more.", "This blanket is incredibly warm without being overly bulky. It helps insulate me against the cold so I don't have to turn my heat up as high at night. Also, my cats love the thermal quality of this blanket. I can't keep them off of it.", "Very nice and comfortable blanket, I ordered this as a replacement for another blanket the dog scratched holes into, after 15 years it was time anyway. Good color and texture, would definitely order more sizes and colors to replace the others.", "I absolutely love everything about this blanket. It's much softer than I previously thought and a single layer is easily capable of keeping you warm at night. I bought one for my girlfriend but I'm going to get a second for myself.", "This is a wonderful blanket!  The size is right.  The weight is right.  I'd have chosen a different color, but the price was unbeatable. And this blanket stays where you put it.  It is replacing one that cost over twice as much that continually \"traveled\" as I slept.  A very good buy!", "This blanket is SUPER WARM!!!  It is the BEST blanket for the price!  Honestly, I was not expecting it to be as wonderful as it is, but it IS!!  If you want a good, warm blanket and are on a budget (or you are looking for a bargain like me) this is for you!  Honestly, I highly recommend it because it is decent looking, and does what it is supposed to do; keep you warm!  It is lightweight, easy to wash and dry and is super fluffy!Get one!.. or two.. or three!", "Warm and soft just as advertised. Also very lightweight, and yet longer than most twin sized blankets (which I highly appreciate since my legs end up sticking out with smaller sized ones). The color was slightly disappointing though- it was more of of a faded earthy brown than \"chocolate\".I suggest renaming that color. Overall highly pleased with my purchase.", "Perfect for what I wanted it for.  We like to put a blanket down inside our tent to catch dirt and protect the tent bottom somewhat.  Our old blanket bit the dust so to say.  I saw this one, and it appeared sturdy and the right color for a floor cloth ---- we recently used and it was perfect! did not seem to show dirt much and the plus side:  My hubby noticed when he was inside sweeping out the tent to fold up and take home- there was very little dirt on the floor of the tent!  so the blanket attracted the dirt and held it- until we shook it out and folded up to take home!  Liked it so much I bought a Queen size one for a spare blanket for Winter!  great quality although I have not washed as yet.", "Just opened the bag today, so have not washed them yet.  They are a good weight, not too light or too heavy.  Seem to be soft and comfy.  The only reason I'm not going 5 stars is I don't know how they will wash.  I have washed fleece type blankets before and had them come out with an weird odor.  If they wash well,  I'll give them 5 stars.", "Once again well done Amazon. Since I buy almost everything from Amazon except cheese steak subs and ice cream cones I guess I shouldn't be surprised that I like this blanket very much. I got the Basil color and while the picture makes it look like light moss green it's more of an Army green like I'd hoped for.I did not notice any defects and it was thicker than some reviewers led me to believe. This might be the best thing for sleep since the invention of the night cap. I also want to thank the Amazonians who prepared it for shipping for their dedication. They went the extra distance to make sure it did not shatter in shipping. I have no reservations about recommending this blanket.", "Brought this for when I moved into my dorm and It's the best blanket I ever owned. I'm always cold so I needed something to keep me warm and this blanket does the trick, not scratchy or itchy its really soft.  Will buy again in another color.", "I have one of these blankets in navy blue that I have had for awhile. I love the versatility of this blanket. It takes me from spring through summer until late fall and seems to adjudge to the amount of warmth I need for each season.It washes well with little to no lint left in the dryer. The sizing is perfect. I ordered this blanket in gray in a twin size for a day bed in my guest room.Bedding is so expensive now days, you can easily spend $400. or more to fit a bed with what is needed. This blanket is so effective and so affordable. Thanks Utopia Bedding for making this blanket and to amazon.com for bringing it to us at such reasonable price!", "I love this blanket. It is soft, just as promised, and warm. Just thick enough without being too heavy. It arrived before the deadline given and was well packaged for shipping. The color,basil, is exactly as pictured.", "Love the feel of this blanket...soft but not the squishy \" plush\" blankets you see everywhere that are flimsy and have no density to them.  I prefer not to use a comforter for sleeping so this is perfect for me most of the year. Someone commented that it does not breath ... but I'll tell you compared to my comforters it breathes well.The only issue I could have is the color... let's just say \" chocolate\" is not the first thing that came to my mind when I opened the package! That being said it is still an awesome blanket and the color is ok ... just not dark enough to be called \" chocolate\" .", "Nice blanket. We looked for another type for the warm summer nights that was light but also warm when needed - this blanket fits the bill. Not quite one of the super plush hotel type blankets, but can hardly feel the weight on you. We got the king basil, true to color and size. Would buy again", "Awesome seller,  even sent a thank you email.  The product itself. Is well worth the to price.  All these people Complaining are clearly not paying attention to the price point.  Would I take this blanket with me on an artic adventure?  Probably not.  But does it work very well in my own home!?  Absolutely I actually found myself removing the blanket at points during the night because I thought it was to hot in the room.  When j removed the blanket I notified it was chilly in my room.  So this is definitely doing what it needs to do very well!  And as far as wearing a hole in it......  What kind of sleeper are you!?  Just get this blanket!  It's super soft and warm end of story!", "I guess I'm a blanket snob as I have many (too many?) really fine, thick wool blankets. I knew this one was synthetic and thinner than one of my usual wool blankets. But it is what it is. For one thing, it cost a tenth or less of one of my wool blankets. And I was pleasantly surprised that it had a nice, soft wool-like feel and no synthetic smell or texture. And the fact that it is washable and thus avoiding the expensive dry cleaning that my wool blankets require is a bonus. I plan to use it as a utility blanket in places and conditions I would not want to expose my wool blankets to.", "Not as supersoft or lightweight as I hoped. The texture is a bit more on the polyester side, like at a hotel. But it's still a very nice blanket for the size and price. And it did soften a bit with a wash & high heat dry.", "It is very long, would fit a Cal-King easily. We actually only have a queen size bed but never can find a blanket that is wide enough. I just laid this one sideways, and it really covers both sides and bottom. It's a little too big, so think I'll get the queen size when i go for a new color as they aren't kidding with the size, but so far it's held up nicely through the washer/dryer, and having large dogs hog the bed when they think they can get away with it. I'm pleased it didn't shrink either.", "Have had morning allergy problems for years, came to the conclusion dust mites would be a big reason why, and finally decided to do something about it! Replace all my bed components, with hypoallergenic products.This polyester fleece blanket is super comfortable and surprisingly warm given the average thickness it has. I replaced an old cotton woven blanket with this one. Have had for nearly a month and no staining or other issues. Allergies are nearly gone too!", "Very nice blanket. Nicer than I expected. Very soft & light but warm. It's also plush; feels like velour or velvet. And, it appears by the craftsmanship that it will last looking like new for years to come. One other point though, the color of the blanket appears darker in the online picture, like charcoal which is darker, not grey as it is advertised. It could be the computer causing it to appear that way though. Because I noticed if I got up from the computer & looked at the color of the blanket from a standing position it was definitely grey, not charcoal at all. The color actually changes because of the effects of lighting on the computer. So, I did receive a grey colored blanket not charcoal colored. Thank you!", "Blankets are thin, not like the Vellux ones I bought years ago...now I hear those blankets can't even be washed without falling apart!!  I haven't washed these yet, maybe I should've when they arrived...but two blankets on my bed-ridden mother seems to do the trick, and perhaps the thickness is a blessing in disguise because summer is coming, and the lighter blankets might be better for that weather...sorry can't saw too much more--took awhile for shipment, but came undamaged", "Shipped quick to Hawaii and package was undamaged... the product was correct size and its one of the best blanket i have ever got... feels very comfy and altho Hawaii doesnt get 'cold' like some other places it still cozy enough on some cold nights :) would recommend to friends/family and would buy again if needed!I just got it so i havent washed it but seems like it will hold out and last a very long time, btw they should add more colors :P", "Thin, not much of a step up from a $5 Walmart emergency blanket to be honest.It's summer and I have the AC set at 72 degrees F...and this blanket is insufficient for sleeping under. The \"polar\" and \"thermal\" terms in the product name are descriptors I just can't stand behind.The blanket is made acceptably well, but for me it hasn't lived up to the marketing.", "Perfect for summer or winter. I have no idea how they can sell them for so cheap! Washes like a dream too.Bonus - the way it sits between the sheeting and our top quilt makes it really easy to make the bed in the morning. The material helps the other bedding from sliding all over the place.Loved the gray color - very neutral.", "Have had it a few days now....well made and quite warm...so much so that I've already ordered another in a different color. Have ordered other Utopia products in the past....they are a great value...5 big stars!!", "I revieved this blanket a few days ago.  Although its still hot outside we are getting our supplies in for winter.  This blanket is awesome.  I got the King Size and it fits the bed well.  It is very soft and is a good comfortable blanket.  I am impressed with the quality.  I will most likely buy more of these in different colors now that I know they are of good quality.  A+", "I have many different kinds/brands of fairly lightweight, microfiber-type blankets.  This is my favorite so far.  It is a bit thicker than most.  Some are basically about the thickness of a thick flannel sheet, but this is more substantial.  It is perfect for slightly cool nights and, with a comforter, I can see it being great for really chilly evenings.  I plan on purchasing more.  It did wash well and it is soft and fluffy.  I would definitely suggest using fabric softener, but then I think most blankets need that for softness and to keep down static.  Definitely five stars.", "Bought this for my daughter as we live in chilly Tennessee and wanted something for her bed that would be lightweight yet warm.  This fits the bill and is a good price for a lovely product.  It has been washed and still retains its looks, with no pilling or fading.  Got the Grey one which is a lovely color and just like the picture on the Amazon site.", "This blanket is SUPER thin, moderately comfortable, and reasonably warm.  It's ok.  It's not a great blanket by any means, but for the price, it was a pretty good value.  It would be up in arms if I paid like $75 for it or something, but for the price, it was definitely a quality purchase.  I'd give it 3.5 stars overall.", "The blanket is soft and true to size. I washed it immediately upon arrival and it has started shedding. Little lint balls everywhere:(", "The blanket is very soft, and so big that there have been -NO- blanket-hogging issues!  I'm glad that I chose this blanket to purchase.  It's been washed 3 times, and doesn't show any signs of pilling.", "I use this as a layer underneath a lightweight down comforter. It is doing a nice job. A blanket adds that comforting weight, but this one doesn't add too much. Has not pilled though I haven't tried to wash it. Haven't had it through winter, but have had some cold, spring desert nights.", "This blanket is so comfortable and soft, and the multiple settings make it very easy to adjust based on personal preference. I also appreciate the long cord so the temperature control portion is not poking me in the back while I sleep.", "This seems like a pretty nice blanket for the price, though I am going to send mine back. The color wasn't what I expected. I bought grey but the blanket is actually a lighter tone than the first/main picture lead me to believe. The other pictures of the blanket are more accurate.", "I bought a king  sized one of these, and made a sleeping bag out of it; very roomy. It is cuddly soft, and quite warm. I use it alone in mild weather, and with however many blankets are comfortable when it's cold. Most sleeping bags are too confining, and you end up sleeping on the zipper. This system works great, and I'm never too cold or too warm. I like that I can wash it in my machine after each camping trip. I couldn't do that with my sleeping bag without a trip to the laundromat and big bucks.", "I purchased this blanket for my daughter at camp and she absolutely loved it. It's plush and comfy and warm. She was the envy of the camp staff. The basil color is a nice neutral green - perfect for camping. This blanket helps to take the chill out of cold nights.", "This is a great blanket, which holds up well in the wash. What more can I say? I had bought this as a replacement for a similar blanket that I bought at a local store. That blanket filled my washer with lint and was a mess after first wash. I have had no such problems with this blanket, and I am pleased. I will most likely order more in the future.", "As soon as it arrives, Put it in the washer with cool water and get rid of the sizing that put on this thing.  It is much softer and flexible after washing.  And It held up very well in the dryer too.  It has turned out to be a new favorite of mine.  Good size, and snuggly warm, who could ask for more.  It's a winner folks.", "I bought 4 of these (2 olive, 2 grey) because I needed to restock my blankets and had company coming to stay for a week and they were a great price, but I didn't expect much because of the price.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  They are absolutely beautiful, thick and soft and cozy!  I got the King size, and they are true to size--even fit my CA King bed nicely!  Because of the size and material, I expected to get a full lint screen a few times on each of them after the first wash/dry...NOT SO!  There was barely any lint after drying all 4 of them!  GREAT PRODUCT, ESPECIALLY AT THIS PRICE!", "This is a lovely blanket and I use it everyday. It is extremely soft and keeps me warm - I ordered it in the twin size and it was still large enough for me to use it folded in half on a twin bed. Highly recommended!", "This blanket arrived quickly and as described. Fit perfectly inside my duvet cover, so I know they did not skimp on the dimensions. The price/quality ratio is excellent. I recommend this blanket if you don't want the heavy weight of a comforter plus a duvet cover. It is also a good weight and not too light. I recommend the seller as well.", "Surprisingly nice blanket. The color is a little more grass-green than the picture, which isn't bad, but it was different. It's a light blanket, but soft and layers up well with others. This works just fine as a top blanket for a queen bed.", "I thought I was getting a heated blanket as that was my search criteria. However, when it arrived, I started using it and I have not regretted it since. It's incredibly cosy and keeps me wonderfully warm. I definitely won't require a heated blanket at all, that's for sure.", "I was looking for medium weight blanket to replace an old tattered one and took a chance with this. I was initially concerned by what I perceived to be the thinness of the package, but once spread out and used, it was just the right  weight! Good product!", "I just love this blanket. It is beautiful and warm. Looks great on the bed and covers my entire queen size bed. I am very happy and you cannot beat the price. Compared to other companies, Utopia is the best. I will keep buying their products through Amazon.", "Perfect for the guest bedroom as a topper or an extra blanket.  We have friends who like to visit with a dog that sleeps on the bed, so this will protect the comforter.  I was so impressed that I bought a second one for our bed (and our dog).", "I didn't have much of an expectation after opening the package- then I washed it. It softened right up and we are so happy with this blanket. Super warm like other reviewers have said. It wasn't as soft as I had hoped coming out of the package but like I said softened right up after a wash. Very happy!", "These blankets are large and soft.  I have a Twin XL bed and the blankets fit perfectly.  They seem warmer than the fleece throws.  I keep my house at 73 degrees F 24/7 during the winter.  One of  these blankets keeps me comfortably warm.", "Indeed a loveable blanket - soft, light-weight, no odor.  Light enough that I plan to stack a second when the indoor temperature drops below 55 degrees.  For this 75 year old Polar-Fleece Thermal Blankets are a modern miracle.", "As with everything I've gotten from either Utopia Towels or Utopia Bedding, this blanket is fantastic. The workmanship is wonderful, and the packaging is very professional. This is a first-class product for an excellent price.", "Beautiful blanket. Soft and warm, I keep it folded over the back of my sofa to grab and snuggle into while watching a movie. It's very lightweight, which I was looking for since I have pain in my feet and even light pressure is often too much. This blanket, however, settles like a cloud over my feet and, so, offers warmth with very little weight.", "Got 2 of these blankets for the new twin beds with trundles for my grandkids.  They are a great size, bigger than I expected and seem the perfect weight, light and yet warm. I have not washed yet, but they seem well made, not cheap.  For the price I think these are a steal!", "These blankets are quite soft and oversized too (just what I was wanting)!  Gray goes with everything in my house and I bought one for each bed at our summer home. I bought four blankets for $67... that's a real bargain!", "Its a good buy for the price... this blanket is awfully thin though. I wouldn't recommend it for those in colder climates as a warmth blanket.  Its good for the mid south kind of winters where it doesn't get to cold.  The color is exactly as described and pictured.  I'm not complaining because of the lacking thickness but I grew up in a colder climate and am aware that this may not be what people who are in such climates are looking for hen they purchase a fleece blanket.", "Very soft blanket, came in a nice plastic bag with a zipper.  Good under layer for my children's bed.  the color is a little dismal, but you don't see it with the comforter over it and it adds nice warmth.", "Husband loves this blanket. He says it keeps his top comforter from getting wadded up. It was washed before the first use & did shed quite a bit of the extra loose fleece. So I'd recommend washing before using.", "Not too heavy, not too light. Excellent blanket.I ordered queen size and it is queen size and a little more which I was happy with having purchased other bedding from retail stores that just barely fit.", "Very comfortable, pretty warm, and washes well. i didn't even have to dry it. It came out of the washer dry enough and good to go. It's a perfect all around blanket, but for colder nights you'll want an extra blanket or something warmer."]]
