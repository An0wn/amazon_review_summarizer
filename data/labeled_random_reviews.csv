The cord seemed to be well made and well shielded. However, it was about a month later when the cord started having connectivity problems. It was definitely the cord as the phone had no issues with other cords.I called the support number and was pleased to see that a live person answered my call immediately and shipped me a replacement cord, no questions asked. Also, remember that the cord has a one year warranty.I received a new cord within a few days and I was happy to give this company another go. The second cord worked perfectly for a few months then it, once again, started having the same issue again. It would not connect unless I held it slightly to the right and wrapped my cord around the phone to maintain the cord in that position. I am a little frustrated with having two cords fail on me, especially since I don't place a lot of strain on the cords, nor do I bend them or twist them in a way that should damage two cords. Any pressure exerted on the cord is just normal use. This hard capsule does not apply the cord any flexibility and therefore creates a break when the line bends too much. I noticed that the head was too flexible and a turn left or right of the connection head would change the cord's position enough to sever the solder connection."

At the end that plugs in to the iPhone the cable separates from the plug and the little wires inside begin to twist and finally break.  It has happened to both the cables I use between my iPhone and my computer and also with the cables I use in my car.The Apple design is much better because there is a rubber collar at the point the cable meets the plug.  This protects the cable from bending at the point where it enters the plug. Apple cables will still fail right at the point the cable enters the plug but the genuine Apple cables I've purchased last 3 or 4 times longer than AmazonBasics cables.

Then why on Earth are you asking people who visit your site to enter a zip code or even an exact street address to find out how many channels they can expect to receive???For me, this was not a superior antenna, and my customer service experience was terrible.Finally, the velcro fasteners they include for you to attach the antenna to a surface are not effective.  After less than a week, when the temperature changed, they weren't strong enough to keep my antenna anchored to the window.I'm giving this antenna 2 instead of 1 stars because it functions like an average antenna, but you can save yourself time and probably some $$ by just going to your local Radio Shack and buying an antenna."

First what would you gain if you simply installed this 6Gb/s drive in an existing computer with only a 3Gb/s chipset? 6Gb/s: Average 154 Max 188 Burst 116 (anomaly?).For now my Windows bootup and shutdown times did not improve, actually got longer a bit, but that may be a result of  mirroring the old drive onto the new one with some file locations now not being in an optimum place.So in summary you will benefit from an upgrade even with older SATA interfaces, and even more so if you can match the 6Gb/s on the drive with a 6Gb/s on the motherboard (preferably the Intel vs Marvell chipset). Because of the smart Seagate drive alignment I am not able to properly align 512 sectors along a 4096 partition start with WinXP. Also the drive seems to have a very short delay before parking heads. As a result the drive is silent, then after you browse say a few pages on the web, you will hear it unpark itself.7/25/12 Update Downgrade to one star. An intermittent chirping noise (the head parking) from the drive became constant and the drive failed. The applicable firmware upgrade at Seagate mentioned elsewhere says my drive is not compatible. If your drive starts to make the chirping noise, BACK UP QUICK, look for a frmware update and check the warantee. "

They worked fine for years on the other drives without attach point failures!With the small size of this drive, you really need some way to assist in pulling it out of a USB port and with the VERY delicate construction of the attachment ring, I have no doubt that this would have failed anyway in just day-to-day use removing it from USB ports.I purchased this one to replace the 4Gb flash drive I've had on my key ring for about three years now. I had the drive for about 3 months when I took my keys out of my pocket after work one day and noticed that my flash drive was no longer attached to my key ring! Now, in all fairness, I probably should have used a short nylon lanyard to attach this to my key ring as this would have minimized the direct wear to the attachment ring. But I did use two small ring clips off of some older flash drives I no longer use. Overall, it's a great little drive, but if you are concerned about securely attaching this for portable use, then you may want to look elsewhere for one that uses a chassis boss, or an integrated rod, or post with ring clips instead of the small wire attachment clip this drive uses."

1,3,Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens - Fixed (Discontinued by Manufacturer),lens,0.201,0.9757,19,"I own a Canon Rebel 2000 and Digital Rebel XT and have used both these lenses for several months.  Pictures have been outstanding and my professional customers frequently cite the sharpness, light balance, depth of field, color reproduction, and ""bokeh"" (intentional blurring of background in portraits) from these lenses.  Some people question the usefulness of a 50mm lens on digital SLRs with a 1.6x crop factor (i.e., 50mm lens = 80mm on a dSLR like the Digital Rebel XT)... WHAT DO THESE LENSES HAVE IN COMMON?  They are both fast (the f1.4 is blazing fast - dSLR can hardly keep up!), details are incredibly sharp (you can see individual hair strands), virtually no chromatic (color) aberration, no dithering or shadows in the corners, focusing is rapid and quiet (thanks to Canon's patented Ultrasonic USM technology) and photo quality parallels even my professional Canon ""L"" lenses.  These fixed aperture lenses also provide superior pictures than telephoto lenses at 50mm because of better glass and aspherical elements.HOW ARE THESE LENSES DIFFERENT?  Having tested both lenses across 1500+ pictures, there are 5 key factors that make the f1.4 superior (justifying the $300+ price tag).1) FASTER ESPECIALLY IN LOW LIGHT: Extra f-stop makes the f/1.4 better for indoor photos or low light.  The f/1.4 is metal, weighty, and is for the proud lens owner5) CLEANER ""BOKEH"" - f/1.4 produces beautiful blurring of background in portraits (""bokeh"") while the f/1.8 leaves less clean edges.  Canon reviews suggest this is due to the f/1.4 having 8 lens elements vs. 5 elements for the f/1.8WHICH LENS SHOULD YOU BUY?  If you are a budding photographer looking for a ""play lens"" then the f/1.8 will more than over-deliver.  If you are a photo professional, you already have the f/1.4 lens among your bag and are not reading this review. :-)"

If I recharge these batteries, then put them in the camera, 9 times out of ten the flash will operate properly, leading me to believe these do not hold the voltage for as long as they claim in storage, and also do not seem to be able to power the flash unless fully charged, and relatively warm.i am not sure something is not wrong with the camera though, but there is an obvious correlation between battery state of charge and flash functionality 90% of the time.  I have no Alkalines or other rechargeables to test with to see whether it is these batteries, or the Camera, which otherwise has been an impressive unit."
